Character Compendium and Dramatis Personae
This document accompanies the screenplay Flower Wars and is intended as a character
bible for writing, revision, casting, and historical grounding. It consolidates all principal
and secondary characters appearing across the existing draft, including those implied
by structure and theme, and situates each within a coherent psychological, social, and
political backstory. It should be read as an interpretive scaﬀold rather than a rigid
constraint, allowing performance and revision to discover further depth.
Tlacaelel
Role: Protagonist. Imperial strategist, reformer, architect of the Flower Wars. Age
Range: Late 20s at introduction; late life by ﬁnal scenes.
Tlacaelel is depicted as a systemic thinker embedded within power rather than
opposed to it. Historically attested as a key advisor to Itzcoatl and a central ﬁgure in
Mexica state ideology, the screenplay presents him less as a visionary mystic than as
a logistical and moral accountant of violence. His deﬁning trait is not idealism but
refusal of waste. He experiences war not as glory or sacrament, but as a consumptive
process that threatens its own preconditions.
Psychologically, Tlacaelel is restrained, inward, and meticulous. He speaks rarely
and precisely, preferring numbers, calendars, and constraints to rhetoric. His conﬂict
is not with the gods as such, but with human intermediaries who mistake appetite
for necessity. The Flower Wars emerge from his attempt to reconcile cosmology,
demography, and continuity into a single operational structure.
His arc progresses from conﬁdent system-builder to reluctant archivist. By the
ﬁnal act, he no longer believes in permanence, only in the value of memory. His legacy
is not victory but proof of possibility. This characterization aligns with the thematic
emphasis on bounded violence and historical fragility already established in the draft

Citlali
Role: Tlacaelel's wife; domestic and ethical anchor.
Age Range: Mid-20s at
introduction.
Citlali is ﬁctional but essential. She is neither advisor nor antagonist, but a
stabilizing counterweight who insists on consequences beyond policy. Where Tlacaelel
thinks in generations, Citlali thinks in bodies, homes, and children. Her intelligence is
practical rather than doctrinal; she does not argue cosmology but asks what survives
its implementation.
Citlali's deﬁning characteristic is clarity without ambition. She recognizes danger
early and articulates it without drama. Her pregnancy, revealed late, is not melodrama
but a recalibration of stakes: Tlacaelel's abstractions must now contend with a future
that is literal, embodied, and fragile.
She functions structurally as the screenplay's resistance to total abstraction. When-
ever systems threaten to become self-justifying, Citlali reintroduces cost.
Nezahualcoyotl
Role: Philosopher-king of Texcoco; intellectual ally. Age Range: Early 30s.
A historically attested poet, ruler, and thinker, Nezahualcoyotl is presented as
Tlacaelel's closest intellectual equal. He understands the proposal of the Flower Wars
immediately, not because he agrees with it emotionally, but because he recognizes its
logical elegance.
Where Tlacaelel is austere, Nezahualcoyotl is ironic and reﬂective. He speaks more
freely, often framing arguments in metaphor or paradox. He serves as a bridge between
governance and philosophy, oﬀering articulation where Tlacaelel oﬀers structure.
His presence reinforces that the Flower Wars are not an isolated innovation but
part of a broader Nahua intellectual milieu concerned with impermanence, balance,
and recurrence.
Itzcoatl
Role: Emperor of the Mexica. Age Range: 40s.
Itzcoatl is pragmatic, politically exhausted, and acutely aware of imperial precarity.
He supports Tlacaelel not out of ideological conviction, but because the existing model
of conquest is visibly unsustainable. His garden imagery underscores his worldview:
growth requires pruning, but pruning must be deliberate.
He functions as an enabler rather than a driver. His support is conditional and
singular, reinforcing the danger of partial revolutions. Itzcoatl understands that once
restraint becomes policy, it becomes a liability if not universally enforced.

Moctezuma
Role: War captain; future emperor; structural antagonist. Age Range: Early 30s.
Moctezuma is not a villain but a rival model of rationality. He believes war is
fundamentally about hunger and fear, not balance. His opposition to the Flower Wars
is grounded in concern that predictability erodes deterrence.
Psychologically, Moctezuma is disciplined, controlled, and deeply traditional. He
fears not cruelty but softness. His arc is one of watchful skepticism: he allows the
system to operate, waiting for its failure rather than provoking it.
His presence ensures that the screenplay's conﬂict remains internal to Mexica
governance rather than externalized. He embodies the argument that empires endure
through fear, not mutual recognition.
Tizoc
Role: High Priest of Huitzilopochtli. Age Range: 50s.
Tizoc represents institutional religion not as superstition but as cosmological
administration. He does not dispute Tlacaelel's logic so much as its risks. For Tizoc,
fear is a necessary language; if it is not spoken regularly, it loses coherence.
He is politically astute, aware that ritual authority depends on visible blood. His
cooperation with the Flower Wars is conditional and tactical. When the system
becomes too clean, he moves to reintroduce danger through supplementary sacriﬁce.
Tizoc's role complicates simplistic readings of Mexica religion, presenting it as an
internally consistent system with its own risk management logic.
Xochitl
Role: Runner, messenger, witness, inheritor of memory. Age Range: Mid-teens to
middle age across the ﬁlm.
Xochitl is ﬁctional but structurally central. She embodies infrastructure rather
than ideology. Her body carries the system's messages; her endurance reveals its strain.
She begins as a precise, obedient runner and evolves into a custodian of memory when
command structures erode.
Her death whistle functions less as a weapon than as a semiotic device: signaling
transitions, violations, and ultimately remembrance. Xochitl's arc mirrors the shift
from governance to survival, from protocol to continuity.
She represents the generational transmission of constraint, even after institutions
collapse.

Tlatoani
Role: Veteran warrior; ﬁeld-level practitioner of restraint. Age Range: 30s.
Tlatoani is a professional soldier adapting reluctantly to new rules. He is not
ideologically invested in the Flower Wars, but he recognizes their operational value
once implemented. His authority comes from competence rather than rank.
He serves as the screenplay's lens into how doctrine translates into bodily practice.
His corrections, commands, and hesitations demonstrate the diﬃculty of enforcing
restraint under pressure.
Malinal
Role: Warrior; exemplar of disciplined combat. Age Range: Early 20s.
Malinal is a capable ﬁghter whose inclusion emphasizes that Mexica warfare was
not exclusively male. She adapts quickly to capture-oriented combat and becomes a
visual proof that restraint requires skill rather than weakness.
Her moments of hesitation and post-combat shaking underscore the emotional cost
of control. She is not heroicized but respected.
Yacanex
Role: Young warrior; transitional ﬁgure. Age Range: Late teens.
Yacanex begins as inexperienced and emotionally raw. His deﬁning moment is
linguistic rather than violent: learning to say "I am captured" instead of "I am killed."
His arc tracks the internalization of a new grammar of war.
He represents the generation for whom the Flower Wars are not an innovation but
a baseline, making their eventual collapse more tragic.
Xicotencatl
Role: Tlaxcalan war leader and negotiator. Age Range: Mid-40s.
Xicotencatl is pragmatic, suspicious, and politically lucid. He understands that
the Flower Wars beneﬁt both sides while binding them into mutual vulnerability. His
consent is never enthusiastic, only calculated.
He provides the external mirror through which the Mexica system is tested. His
warning—that endurance cuts both ways—foreshadows the system's fragility.
Ixtlil
Role: Master obsidian weapon-crafter. Age Range: 60s.
Ixtlil embodies material intelligence.
His skepticism is technical rather than
ideological: obsidian does not forgive intention. He understands that asking weapons

Flower Wars — Character Compendium

to wound without killing transfers responsibility onto the wielder.
He grounds the screenplay's abstractions in craft, fracture, and consequence.
Yaotl
Role: Jungle relay station keeper; former warrior. Age Range: 40s.
Yaotl is infrastructure personiﬁed. Injured, observant, and dryly humorous, he
represents the long tail of warfare: those who survive but are no longer ﬁt for spectacle.
His station is a hinge between cities, wars, and information.
Cuauhtémoc
Role: Young noble; future emperor. Age Range: Late teens.
Cuauhtémoc appears brieﬂy but meaningfully. He absorbs Moctezuma's skepticism
while questioning its inevitability. His presence situates the Flower Wars within a
longer historical arc, hinting at futures beyond the ﬁlm's frame.
Minor and Collective Roles
Scribes, priests-in-training, council delegates, market women, coastal watchers, and
unnamed warriors function collectively rather than individually. They are treated as
distributed cognition: the city thinking aloud. Their reactions—hesitation, gossip,
recalculation—are essential to conveying how systemic change propagates socially.
Set and Production Design Description
The visual world of Flower Wars is constructed around the principle that space itself
carries memory. Sets are not neutral backdrops but repositories of ritual, governance,
labor, and erosion. Each location is designed to communicate constraint or its absence,
and to register the slow transition from structured violence to unbounded conﬂict.
Materials age, boundaries blur, and symmetry gives way to improvisation as the
narrative progresses.
Tenochtitlan: The City as Instrument
Tenochtitlan is presented not as an exotic spectacle but as an engineered organism.
Stone causeways, canals, markets, and temples form a legible geometry that reﬂects
administrative intelligence.
The city feels planned, measured, and continuously
maintained. Walls are plastered and painted in muted mineral tones—reds, ochres,
blues—that suggest symbolic order rather than ornament for its own sake.
The city's deﬁning visual quality is alignment. Streets meet canals at deliberate
angles. Buildings face inward toward communal space. Even domestic interiors are

Flower Wars — Character Compendium

arranged to echo civic logic, with mats aligned to doorways and hearths centered rather
than hidden. This order reinforces Tlacaelel's worldview: violence, like architecture,
must be bounded if it is to sustain what it protects.
As the ﬁlm advances, this alignment begins to falter. Barricades interrupt sightlines.
Temporary structures lean into permanent ones. The city remains inhabited, but its
clarity degrades. The set design should allow this transition to occur subtly, without
explicit commentary.
The Great Temple Complex
The Great Temple is vertical authority made visible. Its stone surfaces are worn smooth
by ritual repetition, not decay. Glyphs are deeply incised and carefully repainted,
signaling ongoing cosmological maintenance. Firelight and copal smoke are constant,
softening edges and ﬂattening depth, making scale diﬃcult to judge.
Interior chambers are narrow and acoustically resonant. Sound carries upward.
Chanting and breath echo, reinforcing the idea that ritual speech ascends. The altar
spaces are not chaotic or bloody by default; they are orderly, procedural, and intensely
formal. Sacriﬁcial instruments are displayed as tools of oﬃce, not weapons.
As restraint erodes, the temple grows louder rather than more violent. Additional
braziers are lit. Smoke thickens. The space becomes saturated, signaling escalation
through density rather than gore.
Flower War Fields
The Flower War ﬁelds are deliberately modest. They are not arenas or grand stages,
but carefully selected stretches of land marked by stones, banners, and boundary
glyphs. The ground is level, cleared, and readable. Nothing obstructs vision. Combat
occurs in daylight whenever possible.
These ﬁelds are visually deﬁned by emptiness. There are no fortiﬁcations, no
hiding places, no terrain advantages. This neutrality emphasizes mutual recognition.
Everyone sees everyone else. The absence of spectacle is the spectacle.
As the system weakens, these markers disappear or are ignored. Grass grows tall.
Stones are displaced. The same land becomes unrecognizable without its symbolic
framing, underscoring that meaning is imposed, not inherent.
Toltec Ruins
The Toltec ruins are the ﬁlm's deepest temporal layer. They are overgrown, asymmet-
rical, and partially collapsed. Stone heads and reliefs emerge from vegetation at odd
angles, suggesting a civilization whose logic is no longer fully legible.
These sets should feel older than memory but not abandoned. Birds nest in crevices.

Flower Wars — Character Compendium

Roots pry stones apart slowly. The ruins are never lit artiﬁcially; they are shown in
dawn, dusk, or ﬁltered daylight. They function as silent witnesses rather than moral
judges.
The visual echo between Toltec ritual combat glyphs and the Flower Wars reinforces
the ﬁlm's cyclical argument: restraint is rediscovered, forgotten, and rediscovered
again.
Domestic Interiors
Homes are intimate, low-ceilinged, and materially honest. Walls are plastered but
uneven. Textiles are worn and repaired. Storage is visible rather than hidden. Food
preparation and sleeping occur in shared space, emphasizing continuity between labor
and rest.
Tlacaelel's home is sparse but orderly, dominated by codices, counting stones, and
wooden boards used for planning. Citlali's presence is registered through functional
objects rather than decoration. The home evolves minimally, but the light within it
changes—warmer early, colder later.
Domestic sets anchor the abstraction of policy in lived consequence. They remind
the audience what survives policy failure.
Jungle Relay Stations
Relay stations are transitional spaces. Built from stone and wood, they are utilitarian
and exposed. Roofs leak. Glyphs fade. These sets should feel maintained by habit
rather than authority.
The jungle presses constantly inward. Vines creep along walls. Insects dominate
the soundscape. These stations exist because people continue to believe messages
matter.
As the empire destabilizes, the stations remain functional longer than palaces or
temples. This endurance reinforces the ﬁlm's emphasis on infrastructure over ideology.
Armories and Workshops
Armories and obsidian workshops are spaces of disciplined danger. Light is directional
and sharp. Obsidian dust glitters in the air. The sound of stone striking stone is
rhythmic, almost meditative.
These sets emphasize material constraint. Obsidian fractures visibly. Broken
blades are kept, not discarded, reinforcing the idea that failure is instructive. Modiﬁed
weapons sit beside traditional ones without hierarchy, visually embodying ideological
tension.

The Coastline
The coast is deliberately underdeveloped. There are no grand ports, no monumental
architecture. The shoreline is open, uncertain, and exposed. When the Spanish ships
appear, they do so against a background that oﬀers no interpretive cues.
This emptiness matters. It signals that the coming conﬂict does not enter an
existing ﬁeld. It arrives without markers, without ritual, without shared grammar.
Final Visual Register
By the ﬁnal scenes, the world is quieter but less ordered. Sets are not destroyed
wholesale; they persist in altered states. What remains intact are not monuments, but
paths, ﬁelds, and places of teaching.
The last image—the empty Flower War ﬁeld—should feel neither tragic nor
triumphant. It is simply a space that once held meaning and could again. The set
does not explain itself. It waits.
Scene-by-Scene Plot and Action Outline
This outline presents the full narrative progression of Flower Wars in sequential
order. Each scene description summarizes the primary dramatic action, the narrative
function, and the shift in stakes. The emphasis is on causal ﬂow rather than spectacle,
tracking how restraint is conceived, implemented, stressed, and ﬁnally remembered.
Scene I — Tlacaelel's Home, Night
Tlacaelel works alone over codices and counting stones, establishing him as a thinker
embedded in logistics rather than myth.
Citlali observes his preoccupation and
introduces domestic consequence.
Nezahualcoyotl's visit signals that Tlacaelel's
private calculations are beginning to circulate politically. The scene establishes the
core problem: war as demographic and moral expenditure.
Scene II — Toltec Ruins, Dawn
Tlacaelel encounters the remnants of an older civilization whose ritualized conﬂicts
resemble what he is beginning to imagine. Xochitl is introduced as a runner, embodying
the empire's communication infrastructure. The death whistle is sounded, linking
fear, signal, and memory. The idea that war can be shaped rather than unleashed is
visually and thematically seeded.

Scene III — Causeway into Tenochtitlan, Morning
Returning warriors reveal the human cost of unconstrained warfare. Tlacaelel observes
rather than commands, gathering qualitative data through conversation with a young
soldier. The emptiness after victory becomes explicit. This scene motivates Tlacaelel's
resolve to intervene structurally rather than rhetorically.
Scene IV — Emperor's Garden
Tlacaelel presents his proposal obliquely to Itzcoatl. The Flower Wars are framed
as cultivation rather than paciﬁsm. Moctezuma's hostility introduces ideological
opposition rooted in fear of weakness. Itzcoatl grants conditional support, converting
Tlacaelel's idea into policy while making its success a matter of survival.
Scene V — Great Temple Training Chamber
Tlacaelel confronts Tizoc, who articulates the cosmological necessity of blood. Rather
than rejecting sacriﬁce, Tlacaelel reframes its administration. The priesthood is
revealed as a parallel system of governance with its own risk calculus. Cooperation is
uneasy and contingent.
Scene VI — Council Chamber
The Flower Wars are formally ratiﬁed. Boundaries, calendars, and expectations are
codiﬁed. Resistance is visible but contained. The war machine is not dismantled; it is
constrained.
Scene VII — Jungle Relay Station
Xochitl carries the ﬁrst formal invitations to ritualized conﬂict. Tlaxcalan interest is
cautious but real. The empire's informational network is shown to be essential to the
system's viability. War becomes scheduled rather than reactive.
Scene VIII — Moctezuma's Quarters
Moctezuma gathers captains and articulates his counterargument: predictability erodes
deterrence. He chooses patience over sabotage, deciding to let the system expose its
own weakness. The opposition shifts from overt to strategic.
Scene IX — Training Grounds
Warriors retrain for capture-oriented combat. Physical hesitation and frustration
emerge. The diﬃculty of translating doctrine into muscle memory becomes apparent.

Flower Wars — Character Compendium
10
Restraint is shown to be harder than brutality.
Scene X — Obsidian Workshop
Weapon modiﬁcations literalize the transfer of responsibility from blade to wielder.
Craft becomes ideology. The fragility of obsidian mirrors the fragility of the system
itself.
Scene XI — First Flower War Field
The ﬁrst ritualized conﬂict unfolds. Combat is intense but bounded. Language changes
as warriors name capture rather than death. The system works, but only through
constant vigilance.
Scene XII — Archive
Scribes document the battle with unprecedented granularity. War becomes data.
Memory is formalized, and precedent is created.
Scene XIII — Diplomatic Feast
Tlaxcalan leadership negotiates terms. Mutual survival replaces total victory as the
operative goal. Trust remains provisional. The Flower Wars become an inter-polity
institution rather than a unilateral experiment.
Scene XIV — Sanctioned Field
A violation occurs. New rules are introduced to manage rule-breaking. Enforcement
replaces idealism. The system hardens, losing ﬂexibility while gaining authority.
Scene XV — Montage of Flower Wars
The system reaches maturity. Battles recur. Casualties stabilize. Warriors age within
the structure. The Flower Wars become routine, eﬀective, and increasingly impersonal.
Scene XVI — Reﬂective Interlude
Tlacaelel observes the system functioning without him. He recognizes both its success
and its brittleness. The cost of institutionalization becomes clear.
Scene XVII — Coastline
Foreign ships appear. They do not recognize the ﬁeld, the calendar, or the signals.
The Flower Wars are revealed as contingent on shared grammar.

Flower Wars — Character Compendium
11
Scene XVIII — Armory
Moctezuma mobilizes unrestricted force. The old rules are set aside. Tlacaelel does
not resist, recognizing that the system cannot encompass this threat.
Scene XIX — Jungle Engagement
Combat with the Spanish is chaotic and asymmetric. Capture fails as a concept.
Restraint becomes lethal. The Flower Wars collapse in practice.
Scene XX — Great Temple
Ritual intensiﬁes in response to disorder. Blood increases as control decreases. Cos-
mology reacts to failure with escalation.
Scene XXI — Tlacaelel's Home
Citlali's pregnancy reframes the crisis as generational. Tlacaelel abandons system-
building in favor of preservation and teaching.
Scene XXII — City in Flux
Refugees, runners, and soldiers cross paths. Infrastructure persists while authority
fragments. Xochitl salvages symbols rather than obeys commands.
Scene XXIII — Teaching Ground
Tlacaelel instructs youths at a former ﬁeld, emphasizing memory over victory. The
Flower Wars are reframed as a lesson rather than a solution.
Scene XXIV — Relay Station
Xochitl continues running messages without a central authority. Communication
becomes ethical rather than political.
Scene XXV — Archive
The Flower Wars are recorded as ended, not failed. History is stabilized against
mythologization.
Scene XXVI — Toltec Ruins
Tlacaelel acknowledges the continuity of attempt across civilizations. Restraint is
shown as recurrent but fragile.

Flower Wars — Character Compendium
12
Scene XXVII — Empty Field
The ﬁnal Flower War ﬁeld lies unmarked and overgrown. A death whistle sounds as
memory rather than command. The space remains available to future meaning.
This document is intended to support revision, pacing analysis, production planning,
and performance, while preserving the ﬁlm's core argument: that the tragedy of the
Flower Wars lies not in their impermanence, but in the rarity of their attempt. The
materials gathered here—outlines, character studies, and interpretive notes—are not
prescriptions but scaﬀolding, meant to clarify structure without exhausting meaning.
Note: These descriptions should be treated as starting conditions rather than
constraints. They exist to orient interpretation, not to close it. Performers, directors,
and collaborators are encouraged to allow gesture, silence, rhythm, and omission to
complete what the text deliberately leaves unresolved.
