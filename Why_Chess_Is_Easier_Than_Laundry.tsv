0	5440	Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today, we are doing something a little bit different.
5720	6140	Oh, yeah.
6400	10720	Yeah, we're not just looking at a piece of tech or, you know, some historical event.
10940	12640	We are wrestling with a ghost.
13040	17860	A ghost? That is a very dramatic way to start.
18120	21600	It is, isn't it? But honestly, after spending the last few days with the paper,
21820	23400	that's exactly what it feels like.
23420	25300	Okay, I'm intrigued. What's the ghost?
25660	27260	We're talking about difficulty.
27260	32940	You know, that visceral feeling when you're trying to solve a math problem
32940	34880	that just won't crack or learn a new language.
35180	37500	And this is a big one for me personally.
38120	43300	Trying to fold a fitted sheet without it looking like a crumpled ball of despair.
43580	47320	The nemesis of laundry folders everywhere. The final box.
47340	49480	Exactly. But here's the thing.
49980	55260	We instinctively feel like difficulty is this heavy thing.
55260	57640	We treat it like a physical property.
57980	61700	Like calculus is heavy and tic-tac-toe is light.
61860	66180	We treat it like weight that, you know, lives inside the task itself.
66520	69060	Right. We treat difficulty like it's gravity.
69260	73180	It's just there, an intrinsic property of the universe that you have to overcome.
73560	77380	But we are looking at a paper today that says, absolutely not.
77380	81480	That entire way of thinking is wrong.
81780	83040	Not just a little bit off.
83160	85560	No, not just slightly off. It's fundamentally backwards.
86780	92780	The paper is titled, Noun-Free Cognition, Difficulty, Abstraction, and the Mobility of Computation
92780	96400	by Flickshannon, published just this year, 2026.
96740	97100	Right.
97100	100640	And it starts with this central mystery that has bugged me for years.
101460	106940	Why are experts so incredibly bad at predicting what computers will find hard?
107580	110260	The paradox of predictable unpredictability.
110540	116760	This is a fascinating place to start because it really, um, it exposes our arrogance as a species.
117020	117680	It really does.
118040	119740	I mean, think back to the 1990s.
119780	121660	Think about Deep Blue versus Kasparov.
121700	122660	Oh, yeah. Huge deal.
122660	124740	The entire world held its breath.
125240	131100	We truly believe that if a machine could conquer chess, this fortress of logic, strategy, and foresight,
131420	132660	that intelligence was solved.
132720	133660	They were at the finish line.
133820	139220	We thought the rest folding shirts, walking upstairs, common sense, was just the easy cleanup work.
139380	140840	We thought those things were trivial.
141480	146460	We assume that because we do them without thinking, they must be, you know, computationally simple.
146800	147140	Right.
147460	149800	We mistook a calculator for a brain.
149980	150240	Yeah.
150240	151440	And now...
151440	153140	Well, now it's a completely different story.
153260	156900	My phone plays better chess than any human who has ever lived.
157960	161240	It can beat a grandmaster while I'm scrolling through social media.
161240	174040	But if I ask a robot, even a billion-dollar cutting-edge robot, to walk into a messy room and just tidy up or fold a warm towel...
174040	175160	It has a nervous breakdown.
175320	175760	It freezes.
175880	176400	Freezes.
176500	179060	It's the classic chess versus laundry paradox.
179060	187300	We assume chess was hard and laundry was easy because we were judging difficulty based on what we find hard.
187520	190800	We projected our own biological struggles onto the machine.
190800	200680	And this paper argues that the reason we keep getting this wrong, why we have self-driving cars that can navigate highways at 70 miles per hour but get confused by a traffic cone...
200680	200880	Right.
201200	203280	...is because we think difficulty is a noun.
203500	204580	We think it's a thing.
204580	209200	And the mission today for this deep dive is to dismantle that.
209200	217980	We need to stop seeing difficulty as a noun, as a static weight, and start seeing it as a relation, a moving target.
218140	220160	A ghost that moves through the system.
220580	221140	Precisely.
221480	224960	If we can get our heads around this, we stop asking, why is this hard?
224960	228100	And we start asking a much more interesting question.
228200	228600	Which is?
228960	231240	Where did the difficulty go?
231420	241720	So let's unpack this difficulty is not weight idea because I have to be honest, when I'm lifting a 50-pound dumbbell, that's 50 pounds.
241880	242300	Sure.
242740	243540	Feels that way.
243760	245100	It doesn't matter if I'm tired.
245280	246500	It doesn't matter if I'm happy.
246700	247920	It's 50 pounds.
248240	250320	Gravity doesn't care about my feelings.
250520	250700	Yeah.
251040	253560	Are you saying a math problem isn't like a dumbbell?
253560	256700	That is exactly what Flickshan is arguing.
256980	259760	If difficulty were like weight, it would be intrinsic.
260060	262000	It would live inside the math problem.
262480	264760	But let's stick with that dumbbell for a second.
264960	265240	Okay.
265520	266260	Is it heavy?
266740	267220	Yes.
268120	268920	50 pounds.
269100	270660	Is it heavy to a forklift?
270960	272060	Well, no.
272700	274080	To a forklift, it's nothing.
274340	278100	Is it heavy if you are floating in the International Space Station?
278220	279420	Okay, I see where you're going with this.
279500	280500	It's weightless there.
280720	281860	The mass is the same.
281860	287020	The heaviness, the difficulty of lifting it, changed entirely because the context changed.
287640	290240	The paper introduces a relational model.
290780	294920	It says difficulty is actually a function of four variables interacting at once.
294980	296760	You can't look at just the object.
296860	297860	Okay, lay them on me.
298080	299020	What are the four variables?
299080	300600	First, you have the task.
300940	303900	That's the abstract goal, like get from point A to point B.
304180	305060	Okay, the task.
305060	306680	Second, you have the system.
306900	310860	That's you, or the computer, or the forklift, the thing doing the work.
311000	311340	System.
311620	312040	Got it.
312300	315400	Third, and this is crucial, you have the prompt.
316120	317100	We'll dig into that one.
317160	317580	It's a prompt.
317900	318420	And fourth.
318500	319320	The environment.
320520	323280	The context, the time, the energy available.
323280	327200	Okay, let's break these down because usually we just lump them all together.
327420	328440	Driving is hard.
328920	332240	But under this model, driving isn't the difficulty.
332640	333080	Exactly.
333520	334200	Let's take driving.
334440	337500	The task is navigate the vehicle to the destination.
338080	339740	Pretty simple, abstractly.
339820	340020	Sure.
340020	345880	The system is a human with eyes, hands, and a brain that's evolved for certain things.
346340	348460	The environment is the road conditions.
349000	351480	So, driving a car is easy on a sunny day.
352180	353400	The task is the same.
353560	354120	I'm the same.
354560	356220	But let's say a blizzard hits.
357220	358780	Suddenly, the environment shifts.
359140	360620	And what happens to the difficulty?
360700	361320	It spikes.
362340	363300	Through the roof.
364140	365060	My knuckles turn white.
365280	366140	I turn off the radio.
366360	367000	I'm sweating.
367000	368820	But did the task change?
368820	370900	You're still just trying to get to the destination.
371180	371380	No.
371620	372280	Same task.
372420	373400	Did the car change?
373640	373940	No.
374420	380520	The difficulty emerged from the friction between the system, you, and the environment.
380800	381340	The snow.
381560	382420	It's a mismatch.
382540	384060	It is a profound mismatch.
384140	385100	And the paper goes deeper.
385760	392440	It argues that we constantly mistake our own compilations, our habits and tools, for the task itself.
392620	394380	Okay, what do you mean by compilations?
394380	396180	Think of them as shortcuts.
397380	397860	Habits.
398340	399020	Muscle memory.
399660	402360	When the environment shifts, those tools stop working.
402840	405680	And that mismatch is what we experience as hard.
406000	408080	So difficulty isn't a thing you encounter.
408420	410740	It's a signal that your tools just broke.
410880	412020	That's a great way to put it.
412300	414040	It's an error message from your brain.
414620	418380	It's the sound of your internal software crashing against a new reality.
418380	421760	I want to dig into that third variable you mentioned, the prompt.
422180	431180	Because, honestly, when I hear prompt in 2026, I immediately think of typing into an AI chatbot.
431760	432380	Of course.
432760	434700	Write me a poem about a sad toaster.
434980	437260	Generate an image of a cat in a spacesuit.
437720	438520	That's a prompt.
438800	442680	And that is exactly the cultural baggage this paper wants to strip away.
442680	449360	We have narrowed the definition of prompt so much that we're missing its actual function in cognition.
449980	450240	How so?
450460	458900	If we only think of prompts as text we type into a box, we miss how the entire physical world prompts us constantly.
459300	461140	So, de-narrow it for me.
461440	464360	What is a prompt in this noun-free world?
464720	470020	A prompt is any specification that partitions the world into given and unresolved.
470200	470760	Whoa, okay.
470760	471820	It's a boundary condition.
472080	475900	It draws a line in the sand and says, everything behind this line is resolved.
476200	477320	You don't need to think about it.
477380	479260	Everything in front of the line, that's your problem.
479380	479640	Okay.
479780	480600	That's a bit abstract.
481200	482000	Partitions the world.
482760	485220	Can you give me a concrete example that isn't a chatbot?
485460	487080	Think about a blueprint for a house.
487280	487500	Okay.
488120	490180	A big roll of paper with blue lines.
490480	492100	A blueprint is a prompt.
493020	495980	Think about the cognitive load required to build a house.
495980	504960	You need to know the load-bearing capacity of the wood, the geometry of the roof pitch, the flow of the plumbing, the electrical layout.
505040	505160	Right.
505200	505800	It's massive.
506000	511440	If a builder had to figure all that out from scratch on the morning of the build, nothing would ever get built.
511520	512000	Exactly.
512000	520680	Honestly, when a builder looks at a blueprint, the geometry of the house, the dimensions, the layout, that is all given.
520820	521500	It's resolved.
521740	523020	It's resolved structure.
523020	528600	The builder doesn't have to derive the math of the roof pitch or decide where the bathroom goes.
529080	532120	That cognitive load has been relegated to the paper.
532300	533920	The paper is doing the thinking.
534240	537320	The paper is holding the frozen thinking of the architect.
537800	541300	The blueprint says, don't worry about the math, just cut the wood to this length.
541900	545800	The builder's unresolved task is just the physical execution.
545800	553480	So the blueprint prompts the construction by removing the need to be an architect in real time.
553620	555540	It's like a time capsule of decision making.
555660	555900	Yes.
556080	557180	It's an act of relegation.
557340	559760	And once you see this, you see prompts everywhere.
560020	560400	There else.
560840	561880	Take a musical score.
562280	562780	Sheet music.
563260	565100	Think about what a musician is doing.
565620	570000	If you didn't have the score, you'd have to compose the music while playing it.
570000	576260	You'd have to decide the melody, the rhythm, the harmony, the dynamics, all in real time.
576400	577280	That's improvisation.
577820	579120	And it's incredibly hard.
579240	581680	It is a huge cognitive load.
582340	590020	But the sheet music is a prompt that relegates the decision of what note comes next and how long do I hold it.
590120	590780	I see.
591060	598640	The composer took on the structural difficulty so the performer can focus on the performance difficulty, the emotion, the timbre, the timing.
598640	599560	That's fascinating.
599740	605840	So a prompt is basically a way of saying, here, ignore all this stuff so you can focus on this one little sliver.
606000	606320	Yes.
606680	608360	And here's the really cool part.
609120	612600	The paper argues that physical objects can be prompts too.
612880	615500	Wait, how can a physical object be a prompt?
615540	620920	Have you ever done any woodworking or even just assembled, you know, IKEA furniture?
621220	622400	I built some bookshelves.
622780	624380	I used a jig to drill the holes.
624500	626000	Perfect example, a jig.
626000	634400	If you need to drill a hole in exactly the same spot on 10,000 boards, you could try to measure it every time with a ruler and a pencil.
634900	635680	That would take forever.
636100	640180	And I'd probably mess up half of them because my hand would shake or I'd misread the ruler.
640340	640640	Right.
640940	647480	That's a high difficulty task requiring intense focus, steady hands, and constant calculation.
648000	649680	But what does the jig do?
650060	651600	It's a clamp with a guide hole.
651600	655540	You just shove the wood in until it hits the stopper and put the drill in the hole.
655720	655960	Boom.
656340	656600	Done.
657060	658620	The jig is a physical prompt.
659140	661160	It resolves the spatial alignment.
661720	664100	It relegates the need for hand stability.
664280	666520	The difficulty is just gone.
666680	673920	The task drill the hole is technically the same, but the difficulty has vanished because the prompt changed the boundary conditions.
673920	678400	This connects to something the paper mentioned about the interface of difficulty.
679160	683480	It said that changing the prompt changes the difficulty without changing the task.
683820	684140	Right.
684340	686420	Imagine a spatial logic puzzle.
686840	694160	If I describe it to you in text, block A is left of block B, which is above block C, it's really hard to solve.
694340	696600	Your brain has to simulate the space.
696740	697680	I hate those.
697680	703060	Susan sits next to the person wearing red, but not opposite the person eating fish.
703240	704840	My brain just shuts down.
704940	705800	It feels impossible.
706260	710620	But if I give you a diagram, a picture of the table with empty slots.
710780	711040	Easy.
711540	711880	Instant.
712340	713200	I can just see it.
713260	714240	I can just move things around.
714400	715680	The task is identical.
716980	718100	Find the seating arrangement.
718740	722340	But the diagram prompt aligns with your visual processing system.
722340	727620	It selects a pre-compiled affordance, your ability to see patterns instantly.
728000	728940	And the text prompt.
729400	730940	It mismatches your toolkit.
731520	736180	It forces you to use your much slower, more energy-intensive logical brain.
736620	738600	So is the puzzle hard?
739180	741340	Or did I just give you a bad prompt?
741560	743440	That is the key takeaway here, isn't it?
743520	743740	Yeah.
743920	745400	Prompts select our tools.
745660	745960	Yes.
745960	751960	If the prompt matches the tools we already have, our pre-compiled affordances, it feels easy.
752340	754200	If it misses, it feels impossible.
754460	758900	Which leads us directly into the mechanism of how we build those tools in the first place.
759020	761860	The paper calls this abstraction as compilation.
762340	764640	I have to admit, this is where I stumbled a bit in the reading.
765280	767400	I know compilation from computer science.
767520	776180	You write code in, like, English-ish words, and the compiler crunches it down into ones and zeros that the machine can run instantly.
776180	776820	Correct.
777100	781960	It turns a complex logical argument into a set of automatic instructions.
782340	784420	It bundles it up.
784520	785320	But I'm not a computer.
785680	786620	I'm not running code.
786760	787000	Yeah.
787220	790040	So how does this apply to me driving to the grocery store?
790300	792420	Think about when you first learned to drive.
792540	794380	Do you remember that first day in the parking lot?
794500	795340	Oh, God, yes.
796060	796900	It was a nightmare.
797100	798480	I was thinking about everything.
798740	800200	How much pressure is on the gas?
800300	801200	Where are my hands?
801560	802960	Am I too close to the curb?
803120	804460	What did the mirrors show?
804460	806700	You were running interpreted code.
806880	811280	You were processing every single line of data in real time.
811960	813540	High cognitive load.
813740	814440	High energy.
815200	816860	You were exhausted after 20 minutes.
817160	818100	Drenched in sweat.
818180	818740	It was awful.
818920	823100	But now you drive to work and sometimes you don't even remember doing it.
823180	825900	You arrive and think, wait, did I stop at all the red lights?
826160	827020	Ideally, I did.
827180	828660	But yes, I know the feeling.
828780	829220	It's automatic.
829420	831340	It's just driving.
831340	834240	That is because you have compiled the process.
834840	838140	Press pedal is now a single atomic action for you.
838540	846800	You are not thinking about the combustion engine, the fuel injection, the friction of the tires, or the hydraulic pressure in the brake lines.
847280	854280	You have an interface, the pedal, and you trust that the underlying machinery will handle the physics.
854480	858400	So my brain has zipped up all that complexity into a single file called go.
858520	859100	Exactly.
859100	860700	But here is the danger.
861340	864200	And the paper calls this the informal theorem.
864940	867560	No compilation remains optimal forever.
867840	873720	Because unlike software, where the hardware doesn't change much, reality is a moving target.
874000	874240	Right.
874400	876900	The pedal abstraction works great on dry asphalt.
877120	878960	The go file executes perfectly.
879240	882260	But let's go back to that snowy day we talked about.
882380	885560	Suddenly, press pedal does not equal go forward.
885920	887760	It equals spin out and die.
887760	889480	The compilation fails.
889640	890940	The abstraction leaks.
891180	891900	It breaks.
892100	893500	And this is that moment of panic.
893720	894840	You have to decompile.
895480	900100	You have to suddenly remember that the car is a physical object interacting with a slippery surface.
900320	903300	You have to pump the brakes, steer into the skid.
903300	906580	You have to think about the physics again from first principles.
906580	913640	And that re-exposure of the internal structure is what we experience as a sudden spike in difficulty.
913640	919120	The paper suggests that expertise is actually a form of fragility because of this.
919240	920220	Wait, hang on.
920460	921720	Expertise is fragility.
922060	924100	I thought experts were the robust ones.
924300	928560	If I hire an expert driver, I expect them to handle the snow better than me.
928560	931800	They can handle the snow because they have a compilation for snow.
932060	933400	That's a pattern they've compiled.
933900	935500	But think about it structurally.
936300	941960	Experts are efficient because they have deep stacks of these compiled shortcuts.
942220	942480	Okay.
942720	948580	They can ignore 99% of the information because they have a prompt or a mental model that handles it.
948660	951400	They see a pattern and they just run the snow program.
951400	957820	But if the context shifts in a way that violates their hidden assumptions...
957820	963300	Like a grandmaster chess player suddenly having to play on a board where the squares change color and gravity shift.
963380	963760	Oh, wow.
963860	965720	They often crash harder than a novice.
965820	968400	Because the novice never had the shortcut to begin with.
968700	969160	Exactly.
969460	971800	The novice was already looking at the raw physics.
972280	973280	They were already struggling.
973560	975960	So the change in context isn't as jarring.
976140	981340	The expert has to unlearn their shortcuts before they can even start solving the new problem.
981720	982840	That makes so much sense.
983020	987160	It's like when a software update changes the location of a button I use every single day.
987280	987540	Right.
987740	990120	I'm paralyzed for like 10 minutes trying to find it.
990700	996180	My mom, who never learned where the button was in the first place, just looks for it and finds it.
996500	997020	Precisely.
997240	1001560	Your expertise, your muscle memory, became an obstacle.
1002080	1003520	It was a brittle compilation.
1003660	1007380	This really explains the chess vs. Tetris thing we started with.
1007900	1009620	This asymmetry of intelligence.
1009620	1014480	The paper argues that chess was a socio-historical artifact.
1014900	1016920	It's a bit of a burn on chess, honestly.
1017120	1017500	It is.
1017580	1025400	It basically says chess became the benchmark for intelligence just because it was hard for us in a very specific human way.
1025600	1030100	It was hard because it required combinatorial, search-looking, many moves ahead.
1030500	1033200	If I move here, he moved there, then I move there.
1033260	1034660	Our working memory is small.
1034660	1035580	It's tiny.
1036020	1038840	We can't hold that many future states in our heads.
1039380	1045620	That is difficult for a biological brain that evolved to hunt and gather and read facial expressions.
1045720	1046640	Not to play chess.
1046760	1047800	Not to play chess.
1048260	1051860	But for a computer, that kind of search is trivial.
1052200	1053340	It's just math.
1053660	1056000	It's a closed system with rigid rules.
1056400	1059880	Once we figured out the structure, we could externalize it.
1060060	1061140	We could write a prompt.
1061500	1063260	The chess engine that solved it.
1063260	1068780	So once the structure aligned with the compilation, the difficulty just vanished.
1069420	1070800	It wasn't inherently hard.
1070920	1072480	It was just hard for meat brains.
1072960	1073400	Precisely.
1073620	1074880	But look at Tetris.
1075220	1077840	Or even better, let's go back to folding that towel.
1078280	1080180	Why is the towel so hard for the robot?
1080460	1083080	I've watched videos of robots trying to fold laundry.
1083280	1083800	It's painful.
1083980	1084940	They move so slowly.
1085060	1085700	They poke at it.
1085720	1086320	They get tangled.
1086460	1086660	Why?
1086760	1087900	What's the core problem?
1088200	1090600	I guess because the towel is soft.
1090700	1091400	It flops.
1091400	1093160	It changes shape every time you touch it.
1093260	1093600	Right.
1093740	1098080	It relies on real-time perception, motor loops, feedback from your fingertips.
1098860	1100400	There is no rigid grid.
1100540	1102660	You cannot just calculate the towel.
1103100	1104380	You have to feel it.
1104540	1110460	And humans have millions of years of evolution embodied compilations that handle that.
1110460	1117520	We have compiled grasping a soft object so deeply that we don't even know how we do it.
1118020	1122880	Try to explain to a robot how to hold a towel without crushing it or dropping it.
1122940	1123140	Okay.
1123340	1126220	Don't squeeze too hard, but don't squeeze too soft.
1126340	1127820	That means nothing to a robot.
1127960	1129220	That's a useless prompt.
1129220	1134900	It involves millions of micro-adjustments per second based on tension sensors in your skin.
1135460	1140760	For the machine, the towel is an uncompiled nightmare of physics simulations.
1141300	1143360	For us, it's just... grab.
1143680	1145860	This is the no final convergence argument.
1145860	1152040	There is this belief in tech, I hear it all the time in Silicon Valley, that AI will eventually
1152040	1155100	just catch up and everything will be easy for everyone.
1155500	1157580	Machines will do what we do, we'll do what they do.
1157700	1160680	And this paper says, no, that's a fundamental misunderstanding.
1160980	1162480	There will always be an asymmetry.
1162640	1164000	Because our histories are different.
1164180	1165500	Our compilations are different.
1165500	1166020	Yes.
1166620	1172080	We are compiled for the savanna, for social nuance, for manipulated physical objects.
1172560	1176140	Machines are compiled for symbol manipulation and massive data processing.
1176460	1181780	We will always find different things hard because we are running on different legacy code.
1181980	1183200	That makes so much sense.
1183740	1186460	We aren't converging on some universal intelligence.
1186780	1190200	We're just distinct systems with different easy buttons.
1190320	1190840	Exactly.
1190840	1195880	And this leads to a massive misunderstanding of technological progress.
1196280	1196740	How so?
1196960	1199720	We tend to think technology eliminates difficulty.
1200340	1203400	We invented the dishwasher, so washing dishes is solved.
1203600	1206580	We invented the internet, so communication is solved.
1206860	1211680	But the paper argues for the conservation of complexity.
1212160	1214440	Or rather, computational displacement.
1214680	1214980	Right.
1215180	1217340	It's not that the difficulty is destroyed.
1217460	1218160	That's impossible.
1218380	1219700	It's redistributed.
1219700	1221260	It has to go somewhere.
1221760	1224500	The example of the one-click purchase really hit home for me.
1225100	1228220	On my end, as the user, I tap a glass screen.
1228720	1229360	One second.
1230080	1231040	Zero difficulty.
1231480	1233240	Low assembly index for you?
1233440	1234300	It's effortless.
1234480	1239240	But for that one tap to result in a package at my door the next day, let's trace that difficulty.
1239360	1239980	Where did it go?
1240420	1241400	It didn't vanish.
1241580	1242720	It exploded outward.
1243360	1247460	To make your experience simple, the system had to absorb massive complexity.
1247460	1252660	You need global logistics networks tracking millions of items in real time.
1252660	1259280	You need server farms cooling themselves in the desert, consuming small cities' worth of electricity.
1259720	1260160	I like it.
1260300	1264400	You need cybersecurity teams fighting off hackers 24-7.
1264660	1269940	You need version control for the app software, A-B testing, user support.
1270060	1272020	It moved into the infrastructure layer.
1272020	1273980	And it moved on to other people.
1274120	1275640	Think about the warehouse worker.
1275760	1278680	That's the hardening of the analog world the paper talks about.
1278800	1279160	Yes.
1279720	1287060	When you make the digital interface smooth and frictionless, you often make the physical reality harder, more brutal.
1287860	1295040	The warehouse worker's job shifts from craftsmanship, or storekeeping, to becoming a component in the machine's logic.
1295040	1296800	They're chasing the algorithm.
1297000	1300400	The robot tells them where to go, how fast to walk, when to take a break.
1300840	1304920	Their difficulty, the physical toll on their body increases to support my ease.
1305120	1307020	The complexity got displaced onto them.
1307300	1311400	And for the rest of us, look at the physical toll of these easy interfaces.
1311660	1315540	We have interfaces optimized for symbols, screens, keyboards.
1316140	1317400	And our bodies are screening.
1318080	1321140	Carpal tunnel, tech neck, eye strain, anxiety.
1321140	1324900	That is the difficulty returning to us in a different form.
1325240	1336140	We removed the difficulty of walking to the store or hunting for food, but we replaced it with the difficulty of sedentary lifestyle management and attention fragmentation.
1336880	1339020	Oh, the attention fragmentation is real.
1339320	1341880	The paper calls this the paradox of efficiency.
1342280	1342840	Exactly.
1343260	1348220	Making things easier to start lowering the friction means we do them more often.
1348340	1349480	I feel this with email.
1349480	1356500	If sending an email cost $5 and took an hour to handwrite, I would send maybe one a week.
1356720	1357360	I'd be thoughtful.
1357580	1359000	But since it's free and instant.
1359240	1360240	I get $500 a day.
1361040	1362820	And I'm expected to answer them all.
1363060	1366040	My entire day is managing this easy task.
1366520	1370620	So what was hard to do, writing a letter is now easy.
1370880	1374480	But what was easy managing your correspondence is now impossible.
1375300	1377740	The difficulty shifted from execution to management.
1377740	1381740	We are drowning in volume because we remove the friction of entry.
1382080	1385400	This feels like a perfect segue into section five, the trap of metrics.
1386160	1388560	Because how do we try to manage this volume?
1388720	1392520	How do companies manage the 500 emails or the warehouse efficiency?
1392840	1393400	We measure it.
1393480	1394560	We count the emails.
1394820	1395020	Yeah.
1395100	1396000	We track productivity.
1396000	1399360	And we run headfirst into Goodhart's Law.
1400100	1406360	Now, usually when people talk about Goodhart's Law, when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
1406760	1408500	They treat it like a data problem.
1408600	1408920	Right.
1409260	1410920	Oh, we just picked the wrong KPI.
1411160	1413020	If we find the right number, it'll work.
1413280	1416920	But Flickshaw argues it's an evolutionary force.
1417000	1417980	It's almost biological.
1417980	1421420	It's about turning a process into a noun.
1421900	1422980	Unpack that for me.
1423200	1424140	Process to noun.
1424260	1424440	Okay.
1425160	1426640	Learning is a process.
1427200	1427900	It's fluid.
1428200	1429080	It's messy.
1429240	1430340	It happens in your head.
1430520	1433700	It involves failure and confusion and insight.
1434080	1436440	But a bureaucracy can't manage learning.
1436740	1437840	It's too ghostly.
1437960	1438600	It's invisible.
1438900	1440280	So they turn it into a noun.
1441120	1441860	A test score.
1441920	1442800	Or a line of code.
1443280	1444320	Or a number of tickets closed.
1444320	1445940	These are static snapshots.
1446080	1453440	And once the system sets that noun as the goal, every actor in the system starts optimizing for the noun, not the process.
1454020	1457620	This reminds me so much of my time working in a call center right out of college.
1457720	1458160	Oh, I bet.
1458340	1459080	We had a metric.
1459600	1460500	Average handle time.
1460940	1462800	We had to keep calls under three minutes.
1463140	1463820	That was the noun.
1464120	1465160	Let me guess what happened.
1466060	1471480	Did you become incredibly efficient at solving complex problems in under 180 seconds?
1471640	1472100	No.
1472100	1474340	We started hanging up on people.
1474760	1477760	If a problem sounded hard, we'd accidentally lose the connection.
1478280	1481580	Or we'd solve the easy part and tell them to call back for the rest.
1482040	1483160	You gamed the metric.
1483620	1485680	We optimized the metric perfectly.
1486120	1487260	Our times were great.
1487840	1492780	But the underlying process, actually helping customers, was destroyed.
1493300	1493820	Completely.
1494240	1496700	Customer satisfaction must have tanked.
1496700	1497880	It fell off a cliff.
1498440	1501400	And that is the optimization death spiral.
1502200	1505580	Because what did management do when they saw satisfaction drop?
1505900	1507360	Did they remove the metric?
1507780	1508640	No, of course not.
1508700	1509620	They added a new layer.
1509720	1510520	They added a new layer.
1510640	1516220	They said, okay, you have to keep calls under three minutes, but the customer also has to give you a four-star rating.
1516300	1518000	And now you have two metrics to game.
1518240	1520260	You just beg people for good ratings.
1520260	1523280	The complexity of the system has net increased.
1523800	1527940	You have added rules to patch the holes created by your previous simplification.
1528400	1531740	This explains why bureaucracies and tech stacks always get bloated.
1532300	1534380	They are patching their own abstractions.
1534380	1539300	They are chasing the ghost of the process they killed by turning it into a noun.
1540140	1541700	That is actually kind of tragic.
1542000	1542320	It is.
1542420	1543640	It's a tragedy of structure.
1543900	1545540	Nobody is evil in that scenario.
1545940	1548180	The system just forces that behavior.
1548600	1549560	But why do we do this?
1549640	1552200	It seems like there is a physics to this behavior.
1552620	1553980	Why do we always take the shortcut?
1554520	1556100	Why do we always game the metric?
1556580	1559860	The paper uses assembly theory to explain this.
1559860	1566900	Now, we don't need to get into the heavy math, but the core principle is the assembly index.
1567240	1571860	Which is basically, how many steps does it take to build this thing from its parts?
1572020	1572360	Right.
1572680	1574800	But the key insight is about selection.
1575720	1581820	The rule of adaptive systems, whether it's evolution or a chemical reaction or a corporate team,
1581960	1585460	is that they do not look for the global best solution.
1585760	1588380	They don't look at the map and plan the optimal route.
1588380	1588820	No.
1589180	1591360	They look for the immediate lowest resistance.
1592060	1593760	Imagine water flowing down a hill.
1593820	1594060	Okay.
1594400	1596500	The water doesn't look at the landscape and say,
1596680	1601720	oh, if I go slightly uphill here over this ridge, I'll find a much faster route to the ocean later.
1602420	1602720	No.
1602940	1603800	It just goes down.
1604220	1604700	Immediately.
1605240	1607220	It follows the slope right in front of it.
1607400	1609500	It takes the next easiest step.
1609920	1612640	Even if that step leads it into a swamp instead of the ocean.
1612840	1613320	Exactly.
1613940	1617540	And in cognition, that means using a compiled abstraction.
1617540	1619020	Using a shortcut.
1619020	1623860	So if I'm a programmer, using a pre-made software library is easier now.
1624100	1626200	It lowers my immediate assembly index.
1626600	1628160	I don't have to write the code myself.
1628280	1631100	But that library couples you to someone else's bugs.
1631360	1631560	Yeah.
1631620	1632600	It bloats your software.
1632800	1634080	It creates technical debt.
1634380	1635920	That is the shortcut trap.
1636180	1640260	We lower the immediate effort, but we raise the long-term maintenance cost.
1640480	1643560	We flow downhill into a swamp of complexity.
1643560	1645300	And here's the scary part.
1645900	1648940	Technological progress just gives us more shortcuts.
1649280	1650080	Oh, right.
1650240	1655820	Greater capability expands the number of pre-compiled libraries, tools, and AIs we can reach for.
1655940	1659040	So we can build things faster, low immediate resistance.
1659040	1662680	But we are building them out of black boxes we don't understand.
1662880	1667440	So we are accelerating the redistribution of complexity into invisible layers.
1667440	1673020	We are building a skyscraper out of bricks we didn't bake on a foundation we didn't pour.
1673440	1675300	And wondering why it sways in the wind.
1675840	1680060	This connects to the philosophy section of the paper, which I found surprisingly deep.
1680900	1683080	The saying versus doing gap.
1684200	1686580	This was in the appendix, but I found it profound.
1686820	1690700	It connects to Ludwig Wittgenstein, the ghost of Wittgenstein.
1690860	1692500	He's the meaning is use guy, right?
1692620	1693360	Language games.
1693360	1693880	Yes.
1694340	1698420	He argued you can't define game or difficulty in a vacuum.
1699300	1702520	The meaning comes from playing the game, from the context.
1703080	1705160	But the paper adds this corollary.
1705880	1707120	Saying is compression.
1707700	1709160	Doing is construction.
1709480	1710700	Saying is a pointer.
1710940	1711640	What does that mean?
1711820	1713180	Think about generative AI.
1713700	1715680	Think about mid-journey or DALI.
1715960	1716320	Okay.
1716320	1725780	If I type the prompt, show me a photorealistic image of a suspension bridge connecting New York to London, the AI generates it in seconds.
1726160	1727480	And it looks incredible.
1727640	1730040	It has cables, towers, water, lighting.
1730140	1730820	It's beautiful.
1731320	1732400	But is it a bridge?
1732600	1732840	No.
1733040	1733580	It's a picture.
1733780	1734780	It's worse than a picture.
1734940	1735500	It's a pointer.
1735980	1739760	If you tried to build from that image, the bridge would collapse instantly.
1740580	1743240	The AI said bridge, but it didn't do bridge.
1743380	1750700	It didn't resolve the gravity, the tension, the wind shear, the steel ratings, the cost of materials, the bedrock on the ocean floor.
1751060	1755020	It pointed to the idea of a bridge without doing the work of the bridge.
1755260	1755700	Exactly.
1756380	1760500	Saying uses a pointer to a region of possibility space.
1761320	1764460	Doing requires building the causal chain to get there.
1764460	1768280	It requires resolving every single unresolved dependency.
1768280	1771220	The paper argues this asymmetry is structural.
1772260	1775240	It will always be easier to say something than to do it.
1775700	1778840	Because language is a lossy compression of reality.
1779040	1780280	It strips away the constraints.
1781100	1787260	And as our tools improve, as we get better AI, we can say things with even higher fidelity.
1787780	1790760	We can generate plans that look incredibly detailed.
1790960	1793600	So the saying has become incredibly sophisticated.
1793840	1794640	It looks like doing.
1794900	1795720	But it isn't.
1795780	1797120	The image is still just a pointer.
1797120	1799200	It has zero structural integrity.
1799720	1802280	This explains why project timelines are always wrong.
1802700	1803380	Ideas are cheap.
1803620	1806580	Ideas are cheap because they are nonified possibilities.
1806880	1807640	They are just pointers.
1808400	1811420	Execution is the re-exposure of all the hidden difficulty.
1811820	1814520	And the paper suggests this gap is widening.
1814680	1821880	We can imagine and prompt systems that are vastly more complex than what we can physically manage or execute.
1821880	1823540	That is daunting.
1824260	1831200	It feels like we are trapping ourselves in a hall of mirrors where everything looks easy but nothing actually works.
1831340	1832240	It can feel that way.
1832340	1833240	It's a real danger.
1833680	1835220	So where does this leave us?
1835620	1846920	I mean, if difficulty is this moving target, this relation, this ghost, if our metrics are lying to us and our shortcuts are traps, what does it mean to be smart?
1846920	1850260	This is Section 8, Implications for Intelligence.
1850560	1851720	We have to redefine it.
1851720	1857220	The old definition was capacity to solve inherently hard problems, like chess.
1857680	1859280	Which we know now doesn't exist.
1859480	1861360	There are no inherently hard problems.
1861480	1864360	There are only problems that mismatch your current tools.
1864560	1866900	So the new definition, what is it?
1867060	1870600	Intelligence is the capacity to navigate shifting boundaries.
1871120	1874400	It is the ability to recompile when the environment changes.
1874580	1875140	I love that.
1875140	1877660	It's not about how fast you can run the code.
1877860	1881100	It's about how fast you can rewrite it when the hardware melts.
1881320	1881720	Exactly.
1882000	1883960	It's about fluidity and adaptation.
1884460	1890300	And the paper defines stupidity in a very interesting way, not as a lack of brain power.
1890520	1893520	But as an overcommitment to obsolete abstractions.
1893860	1901120	Being stuck in your old ways, insisting that the pedal still works even though you're on ice, that is stupidity.
1901460	1902960	It's a rigidity of compilation.
1902960	1905720	This has huge ethical consequences, too.
1906040	1907380	The paper talks about fairness.
1907760	1908340	It does.
1908880	1918000	If difficulty is a relation between the task, the prompt, and your pre-compiled affordances, then you cannot judge two people by the same output.
1918200	1920080	Because one person might have a scaffold.
1921460	1922580	A better set of tools.
1922820	1923240	Exactly.
1923240	1933560	If I grew up with tutors, high-speed internet, a stable home, and fluent English, I have a massive stack of compiled abstractions that resolve difficulty for me.
1933760	1939140	I can focus on the high-level task because the low-level survival stuff is given.
1939560	1940840	It's been humbled for me.
1940840	1947220	And if someone else is dealing with food insecurity, or a second language, or a noisy home, or lack of access?
1947460	1950120	They are decompiling survival every single day.
1950240	1952580	They are spending their cognitive energy on the given.
1953120	1955980	So a task that is easy for me is hard for them.
1956100	1960420	Not because I am smarter, but because my scaffolding is doing the heavy lifting.
1960420	1963460	So fairness isn't about treating everyone the same.
1963680	1965760	It's about looking at the compilation history.
1966380	1970840	And recognizing that responsibility lies in the design of the system.
1971360	1972800	The design of the prompts.
1973560	1977680	Are we designing prompts that only work for people with a specific set of tools?
1977920	1979220	That is a powerful shift.
1979600	1983460	It moves the blame from the individual to the architecture.
1983460	1990180	It forces us to ask, who is bearing the displaced complexity of our simple systems?
1991160	1992080	So we've been on a journey.
1992220	1994940	We started with the paradox of the robot folding laundry.
1995380	1997760	The things we thought were easy are actually hard.
1998060	1998180	Right.
1998680	2001040	We realized difficulty isn't a weight.
2001320	2003720	It's a relation between the system and the environment.
2004440	2009720	We learned that prompts are boundaries that partition the world into given and unresolved.
2010380	2015500	We saw that abstraction is just compilation that eventually breaks when the road gets icy.
2015880	2017840	And that that's what difficulty feels like.
2017840	2022420	We tracked the movement of complexity from the user interface into the infrastructure in the human body.
2022740	2026420	And we saw how metrics turn processes into nouns and break them.
2026640	2028440	A tour of noun-free cognition.
2028920	2030120	So what now?
2030840	2032720	The paper ends with a provocation.
2033380	2034020	A so what?
2034840	2038200	And it uses a metaphor that I think is perfect for wrapping this up.
2038620	2039140	The ladder.
2039520	2040560	The ladder metaphor.
2041300	2043480	It's a nod to Wittgenstein again.
2043480	2046580	He said that his philosophy was like a ladder.
2047420	2049920	You use it to climb up to a new vantage point.
2050160	2051300	But once you're up there...
2051300	2052740	You can throw the ladder away.
2052900	2053940	You don't need it anymore.
2054080	2061380	You don't need to walk around reciting assembly index minimization or prompt boundary conditions in your daily life.
2061560	2063160	You don't need the jargon.
2063320	2064400	You just need the view.
2064700	2066220	You just need to change your seeing.
2066220	2066860	Exactly.
2067800	2070720	The goal isn't to become a philosopher of difficulty.
2071440	2073820	The goal is to notice the ghost.
2074480	2078240	And the call to action is simple but radical.
2078640	2080640	Stop trying to eliminate difficulty.
2080820	2082000	It cannot be destroyed.
2082240	2083580	That is the fundamental law.
2083680	2084800	It can only be moved.
2084960	2086920	And the goal isn't a frictionless world.
2087320	2087680	No.
2087860	2090780	That's a fantasy that leads to fragility and disaster.
2091060	2094580	The goal is to consciously manage where you put the friction.
2094580	2099880	Do you want the friction on the user, on the worker, on the environment, on the future?
2100600	2101980	Because it has to go somewhere.
2102320	2103160	The choice is where.
2103500	2106360	So, to everyone listening, here's your final thought.
2107100	2109900	The next time you are struggling with a task,
2110180	2114020	whether it's a spreadsheet that won't balance a difficult conversation with a partner,
2114560	2116940	or, yes, folding that fitted sheet,
2117960	2120020	don't ask, why is this hard?
2120980	2123640	Because this doesn't have a difficulty.
2123640	2129440	Instead, ask, which of my compiled abstractions just stopped working?
2129660	2133020	Or, even better, who moved the complexity onto me?
2133180	2134260	That is the question.
2134460	2135820	Thanks for diving deep with us.
2135980	2136900	We'll see you in the next one.
2136980	2137640	Keep recompiling.
2137640	2138200	Keep compiling.
2138260	2138720	Keep compiling.
