Simulation as Civic Infrastructure
Preference Revelation and the End of Narrative Coordination
Flyxion
February 4, 2026
Abstract
Contemporary civic and epistemic institutions remain largely organized around narrative
coordination. Education systems, democratic mechanisms, and feed-based social media presume
that collective understanding and preference formation can be achieved through discourse,
persuasion, and symbolic alignment within a shared but largely static background. This essay
argues that such institutions are increasingly misaligned with the structure of the systems
they attempt to govern. As economic, technological, and ecological dynamics become high-
dimensional, nonlinear, and strongly path-dependent, narrative forms of coordination fail to
expose the consequences of choices or to bind preference expression to irreversible commitment.
The essay situates this institutional mismatch within a broader family of scientiﬁc critiques
that reject narrative primitives in favor of relational, scale-free, and constraint-driven structure.
Parallels are drawn to Barbour's denial of fundamental time, Penrose's conformal cyclic cosmology,
and entropic approaches to physical law in which geometry, scale, and temporal direction emerge
from irreversible processes rather than serve as foundational coordinates. Across these frameworks,
explanation advances by abandoning stories told against ﬁxed backgrounds and replacing them
with selection among admissible structures under global constraints.
Against this backdrop, the essay argues that contemporary production has already crossed
an epistemic threshold. Factory simulation, digital twins, and counterfactual optimization
increasingly function as the primary coordination substrate of industrial activity, enabling
global feasibility to be evaluated prior to material commitment. This simulation-native mode of
reasoning renders discourse-centric institutions progressively obsolete, insofar as they continue to
mediate collective choice through symbolic preference expression rather than consequence-bearing
exploration.
The essay therefore proposes shared civic simulation environments, analogous in strategic form
to long-horizon 4X simulations, as a replacement for feed-based coordination and narrative-driven
education. Within such environments, macrostructural alternatives are explored as trajectories
under explicit physical, economic, and normative constraints, and collective preferences are re-
vealed through sustained interaction with consequences rather than through rhetorical alignment.
On this view, simulation becomes a civic infrastructure that reorganizes legitimacy and collective
agency around irreversible trajectories, rendering futures intelligible not as narratives to be
believed, but as structures to be inhabited, tested, and selectively sustained under conditions of
complexity, path dependence, and irreversibility.

Introduction
Many of the most inﬂuential explanatory systems of the modern world are organized as narratives.
They assume a background that remains ﬁxed while events unfold upon it, and they treat the
relevant primitives as beginnings, sequences, and outcomes. In cosmology, the background is
spacetime and the narrative begins with a Big Bang followed by expansion. In political economy, the
background is a market environment and the narrative begins with scarcity followed by growth. In
education and public discourse, the background is a stable social world and the narrative proceeds
through curricula, persuasion, and credentialed advancement. Such narratives can be pragmatically
useful, but their explanatory power depends on a hidden assumption: that the future is suﬃciently
low-dimensional that it can be coordinated by stories.
A diﬀerent tradition has always existed beneath the narrative surface, insisting that what is
fundamental is not story but structure. In physics, this tradition appears wherever scale, time, or
geometry are treated not as primitives but as emergent constraints. Barbour's work denies time as a
fundamental parameter and replaces temporal succession with a relational ordering of conﬁgurations,
where duration is a derivative measure of change (Barbour 1999). Penrose's conformal cyclic
cosmology removes absolute scale at cosmological boundaries, arguing that when mass becomes
irrelevant, metric size loses physical meaning and only conformal relations persist (Penrose 2010).
In the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, expansion and even spacetime are
treated as secondary descriptions of a deeper substrate of irreversible entropy ﬂow and constraint
relaxation, such that temporal direction is identiﬁed with thermodynamic irreversibility rather than
with a coordinate time.
This essay argues that the economy is undergoing an analogous transition. Production is
increasingly organized not by narrative instruments such as plans, slogans, or even price signals
alone, but by simulation infrastructures that explore counterfactual trajectories and constraint
surfaces before material commitment occurs. Digital twins, factory simulators, supply-chain solvers,
and design-to-manufacture pipelines instantiate a mode of reasoning that is explicitly relational,
path-dependent, and consequence-facing. The dominance of this mode in production implies that
discourse-centric institutions become progressively misaligned with the epistemic requirements
of collective life. If the central coordination substrate of production is simulation-native, then
education and social media cannot remain primarily narrative without creating a widening gap
between symbolic preference expression and causal leverage.
The essay therefore advances a further claim. When societies must choose among macrostructures
whose consequences unfold over long horizons and through nonlinear dynamics, preferences cannot
be meaningfully expressed as slogans, votes, or engagement metrics alone. Preference revelation must
occur through sustained interaction with structured counterfactual spaces. A shared civic simulation
environment, analogous in strategic form to long-horizon 4X games, can function as a medium for
exploring competing futures, exposing tradeoﬀs, and selecting trajectories that exhibit robustness
under explicit constraints. In this proposal, simulation does not trivialize politics by turning it into
entertainment; it replaces discourse with consequence-bearing exploration, reconstituting legitimacy
and collective agency around irreversible trajectories rather than around attention.

From Fundamental Narratives to Relational Structure
Modern scientiﬁc worldviews have repeatedly been organized around narrative primitives: a be-
ginning, a sequence of transformations, and an end state governed by laws that act upon a ﬁxed
background. In cosmology this takes the form of an initial singularity followed by expansion; in
2

economics it appears as growth trajectories driven by incentives; in education and media it manifests
as linear curricula and discursive persuasion. These narrative forms are not merely stylistic conve-
niences. They encode deep assumptions about causality, dimensionality, and tractability, presuming
that complex systems can be coordinated through linear descriptions embedded in stable contexts.
The work of Barbour, Penrose, and the RSVP framework constitutes a sustained critique of this
assumption. Barbour's denial of fundamental time replaces temporal succession with an ordering of
conﬁgurations in a relational space, where change is primary and duration is a derived quantity
rather than a governing parameter (Barbour 1999). Penrose's conformal cyclic cosmology performs
a complementary move with respect to scale, arguing that when rest mass becomes physically
irrelevant, metric size loses meaning and only conformal relations persist at the deepest level of
description (Penrose 2010). RSVP extends this line of thought by rejecting cosmic expansion itself
as a primitive explanatory mechanism, treating spacetime geometry as an emergent description of
irreversible entropy ﬂow and constraint relaxation rather than as a causal arena.
Across these approaches, explanation is displaced from narrative progression to structural
selection. Events are no longer explained by their position in a story but by their admissibility
within a constrained conﬁguration space. Low-entropy initial conditions, temporal asymmetry,
and large-scale order are not imposed as boundary stipulations but derived from deeper invariants
governing the space of possibilities. This shift marks a transition from descriptive coherence to
generative adequacy, privileging frameworks that can account for why certain structures persist
while others are dynamically suppressed.
The implications of this shift extend beyond physics. Narrative-based coordination functions
eﬀectively only when the relevant possibility space is narrow enough that local reasoning and sym-
bolic compression preserve causal ﬁdelity. As systems grow in dimensionality and interdependence,
narrative explanation increasingly decouples from leverage. Inﬂationary cosmology, algorithmic the-
ories of mind, and incentive-based economic storytelling persist not because they resolve underlying
structural tensions, but because they preserve familiar explanatory forms. Their resilience reﬂects
sociological path dependence rather than epistemic suﬃciency (Kuhn 1962).
The replacement of narrative with relational structure does not entail relativism or explanatory
retreat. On the contrary, it demands stronger commitments. A relational framework forces explicit
engagement with constraints, tradeoﬀs, and irreversibilities. In cosmology, this appears as the
demand to explain low gravitational entropy without ad hoc smoothing mechanisms (Penrose 1979).
In RSVP, it appears as the insistence that redshift, structure formation, and temporal direction be
derived from entropy gradients rather than postulated expansion. When this demand is applied to
social and economic systems, it points inexorably toward simulation as the dominant epistemic mode,
because only simulation can expose the structure of high-dimensional constraint spaces without
collapsing them prematurely into narrative form.

Simulation as the Native Epistemology of Production
Contemporary production is increasingly organized around epistemic practices that diﬀer funda-
mentally from narrative planning or market-mediated storytelling. Across advanced industrial
domains, decisions are no longer made primarily through linear projections, managerial intuition, or
marginal price adjustments. Instead, they are governed by simulation infrastructures that explore
large conﬁguration spaces before physical commitment occurs. Digital twins, factory simulators,
supply-chain optimizers, and integrated CAD-to-CAM pipelines evaluate counterfactual trajectories
under physical, logistical, and thermodynamic constraints, producing knowledge through structured
exploration rather than discursive justiﬁcation.
3

This development represents a qualitative epistemic shift. Classical economic theory presumes
that coordination emerges from decentralized signals aggregated through markets, with prices
functioning as compressed narratives of scarcity and preference (Smith 1776; Hayek 1945). While
such mechanisms remain relevant at certain scales, they are increasingly bypassed in contexts
where failure is catastrophic, coupling is tight, and path dependence dominates. Semiconductor
fabrication plants, aerospace assembly lines, and large-scale energy systems are not optimized
through discourse or marginal adjustment alone, but through exhaustive simulation of throughput,
latency, failure modes, and resource interdependence. In these environments, narrative explanation
becomes retrospective, serving to legitimize decisions already determined by constraint satisfaction.
Simulation-native production systems diﬀer from narrative planning not merely in speed or
accuracy, but in the kind of knowledge they generate. Narratives operate by suppressing dimen-
sionality, selecting a small number of salient variables and arranging them in causal sequence.
Simulations, by contrast, preserve dimensionality long enough to reveal emergent structure. They
expose nonlinear interactions, threshold eﬀects, and unintended consequences that cannot be inferred
reliably from compressed descriptions. As a result, they alter the relationship between belief and
commitment. One cannot meaningfully advocate a production schedule, a logistics topology, or a
materials substitution without confronting its modeled consequences across time.
This asymmetry between narrative belief and simulated commitment mirrors longstanding
critiques of computational reductionism in theories of mind. Penrose's argument that genuine
understanding cannot be reduced to algorithmic rule-following rests in part on the distinction
between symbol manipulation and engagement with structure (Penrose 1989). Simulation-based
reasoning similarly exceeds the expressive capacity of narrative description, not by invoking non-
computable processes, but by refusing premature compression. It forces agents to internalize the
geometry of constraint spaces rather than merely recite outcomes.
If production has already crossed this epistemic threshold, the persistence of narrative-dominated
institutions elsewhere becomes increasingly untenable. Education systems that prioritize credentialed
explanation over model-based reasoning, and social media platforms that optimize engagement
rather than consequence visibility, increasingly resemble inﬂationary patches applied to failing
explanatory regimes. They preserve surface coherence while deferring structural reckoning. As
simulation becomes the native epistemology of production, the gap between symbolic preference
expression and causal leverage widens, creating pressure for a corresponding transformation in the
institutions that mediate collective choice.
4
From Discourse to Counterfactual Play
The transition to simulation-native production exposes a structural mismatch between the epistemic
demands of collective decision-making and the institutions traditionally tasked with mediating
it. Discourse-based mechanisms such as debate, voting, and persuasion presume that preferences
are stable, communicable, and largely separable from the complex dynamics of the systems they
address. These assumptions become increasingly untenable when decisions concern macrostructures
whose consequences unfold over long horizons, exhibit nonlinear coupling, and generate irreversible
commitments.
Preferences regarding energy transitions, technological acceleration, terraformation strategies, or
ecological restoration cannot be meaningfully speciﬁed in isolation from their trajectories. Expressed
symbolically, such preferences collapse high-dimensional outcome spaces into slogans or positions that
obscure tradeoﬀs and suppress uncertainty. The result is not merely misinformation but structural
misrepresentation, in which the form of expression itself distorts the domain being governed.
4

Narrative discourse, eﬀective for low-dimensional coordination, becomes actively misleading when
applied to systems dominated by path dependence.
A simulation-based civic substrate replaces discourse with counterfactual play. In such an
environment, individuals and groups explore alternative futures within a shared, rule-governed
space that encodes physical, economic, and ecological constraints. Engagement is not evaluated by
assent or rhetorical alignment but by sustained interaction with trajectories and their irreversible
consequences. Commitment is demonstrated through time spent navigating tradeoﬀs, revising
strategies, and responding to emergent outcomes rather than through symbolic aﬃrmation.
This form of participation is often dismissed as gamiﬁcation, but such dismissal rests on a
misunderstanding of the epistemic role of play. In scientiﬁc and engineering contexts, exploratory
modeling and scenario testing are recognized as essential forms of serious work. Strategic simulation
environments formalize this practice at a civic scale. They compel participants to internalize
growth curves, feedback loops, and constraint surfaces in a manner analogous to the way laboratory
experiments force theorists to confront recalcitrant phenomena. What matters is not the ﬁctional
veneer of the environment but the rigor of its constraints and the persistence of its state.
Historically, long-horizon strategy simulations have already demonstrated this capacity in limited
domains. Their signiﬁcance lies not in their subject matter but in their structural form, which forces
reasoning about futures as evolving conﬁgurations rather than as endpoints. When grounded in
real physical and institutional constraints, such environments become instruments for preference
revelation rather than entertainment. Participants discover what they are willing to trade, protect,
or abandon only by living through the consequences of their choices across extended trajectories.
This transition mirrors the movement in cosmology away from narrative expansion histories
toward conformal and entropic descriptions. Just as the universe is no longer explained by a story
of smooth growth alone, societies can no longer be coordinated by stories of progress, disruption,
or innovation detached from structural feasibility. Simulation becomes the medium through which
legitimacy is earned, because it is the medium in which consequences are made unavoidable.
5
Simulation, Preference Revelation, and Macrostructural Selec-
tion
A simulation-centered civic infrastructure does not merely improve the information available to
decision-makers; it alters the very ontology of preference. In narrative-based systems, preferences
are treated as antecedent facts that can be aggregated, negotiated, or represented symbolically.
They are assumed to exist prior to engagement with the systems they govern. In a simulation-based
system, preferences are instead revealed through interaction with structured possibility spaces. What
agents claim to want is repeatedly revised as they encounter constraints, unintended consequences,
and long-term dynamics that were invisible at the level of discourse.
This distinction parallels developments in economic theory concerning revealed preference,
but extends them into domains where outcomes cannot be decomposed into isolated choices.
Classical revealed preference theory infers preferences from observed selections among static bundles
(Samuelson 1938).
Simulation-based preference revelation infers commitments from sustained
engagement with trajectories. What matters is not a single choice but the willingness to continue
inhabiting a path as its consequences unfold. Preferences become functionals over trajectories rather
than orderings over outcomes.
In this sense, simulation environments function as instruments of macrostructural selection. Com-
peting energy regimes, technological acceleration proﬁles, terraformation strategies, or governance
architectures can be instantiated as parameterized worlds whose evolution reﬂects both physical
5

limits and institutional design. Selection among these worlds does not occur through rhetorical
victory or ideological coherence, but through demonstrated viability under shared constraints.
Trajectories that collapse under their own assumptions lose adherents not because they are argued
against, but because their consequences become intolerable when explored in full.
The analogy to cosmology is more than metaphorical. Penrose's insistence that the Big Bang's
low entropy must be explained by inherited conformal structure rather than inﬂationary smoothing
reﬂects a demand that global order be justiﬁed by deeper invariants rather than imposed boundary
conditions (Penrose 2010). RSVP extends this demand by locating temporal direction and apparent
expansion in entropy gradients rather than in metric growth. A simulation-based society applies the
same demand to its own futures. Macrostructures must be shown to arise naturally from constraints
and interactions, not from declarations of intent, moral certainty, or narrative appeal.
This reconceptualization of preference has immediate implications for education. Education
conceived as narrative transmission trains individuals to repeat explanations without internalizing
the dynamics that make those explanations operative. In contrast, education embedded within
shared simulation environments trains individuals to reason in terms of models, sensitivities, and path
dependence. Competence becomes inseparable from the ability to navigate and modify structured
systems, just as scientiﬁc understanding becomes inseparable from the ability to manipulate formal
representations. Expertise is no longer deﬁned by credentialed knowledge alone, but by demonstrated
capacity to sustain viable trajectories over time (Collins and Evans 2007).
The same logic renders contemporary social media structurally obsolete. Platforms optimized
for attention and engagement amplify symbolic alignment while suppressing consequence visibility.
They allow preferences to be expressed without cost and identities to be performed without
commitment. In a simulation-centered civic infrastructure, identity and trust attach instead to
maintained trajectories. Reputation emerges from demonstrated stewardship of complex systems
rather than from visibility or rhetorical dominance. Preference revelation becomes inseparable from
responsibility, because to express a preference is to accept the burden of its simulated consequences.
6
Irreversibility, Legitimacy, and the End of Feed-Based Coordi-
nation
The decisive epistemic advantage of simulation over narrative lies in its treatment of irreversibility.
Narratives can be revised without cost, overwritten by new framings, or abandoned when they
lose persuasive force. Simulation, by contrast, accumulates history. Once a trajectory is entered
and explored, its consequences cannot be unseen, and its costs cannot be retroactively erased.
This accumulation of consequence aligns simulation-based coordination with the thermodynamic
structure emphasized in RSVP, where time is not a parameter indexing events but a record of
irreversible entropy production.
Legitimacy in such a system no longer derives primarily from procedural assent or rhetorical
success. It arises from demonstrated navigation of irreversible processes. Trajectories earn legitimacy
insofar as they remain viable under sustained exposure to constraint, uncertainty, and perturbation.
This conception of legitimacy is neither technocratic nor purely procedural. It is epistemic in the
sense that it privileges demonstrated understanding of structure over symbolic conformity, and
moral in the sense that it binds preference expression to consequence-bearing commitment.
This reconceptualization renders feed-based coordination structurally obsolete. Social media
feeds ﬂatten time into an endless present, erasing consequence through constant refresh. They
privilege immediacy, alignment, and reaction over accumulation and stewardship. In doing so, they
function as anti-thermodynamic systems, continuously resetting attention without allowing history
6

to bind future action. Such systems are well suited to narrative persuasion but fundamentally
misaligned with the coordination of irreversible processes.
Simulation environments, by contrast, enforce temporal thickness. Decisions persist, compound,
and constrain future options. Early commitments shape later possibilities, and recovery from error
is costly rather than cosmetic. This persistence mirrors physical reality more closely than any
narrative medium. As a result, simulation-based coordination produces a qualitatively diﬀerent
form of political engagement. Participants cannot simply endorse outcomes; they must inhabit
paths. Disagreement does not vanish, but it becomes structured around alternative trajectories
rather than rival stories.
The replacement of feeds with simulations also resolves a longstanding tension in democratic the-
ory. Collective choice mechanisms struggle when outcomes are highly path-dependent and nonlinear,
as is the case with climate intervention, large-scale automation, or planetary engineering. Voting on
such issues abstracts away precisely the dynamics that determine success or failure. Simulation-based
participation allows divergence rather than forcing premature convergence. Multiple futures can be
explored in parallel, with resources, attention, and legitimacy gradually ﬂowing toward those that
demonstrate robustness under shared constraints.
This does not imply a technocratic substitution of optimization for politics. On the contrary,
it expands the space of meaningful political action. Values enter the system not as slogans but
as constraints, protected invariants, or cost functions whose implications can be examined rather
than asserted. Ethical commitments become parameters that shape trajectories, making tradeoﬀs
explicit without reducing them to utility maximization. In this sense, simulation does not eliminate
disagreement; it makes disagreement legible at the level of structure rather than at the level of
identity.
7
Simulation Civilizations and the Reorganization of Collective
Agency
The transition from narrative coordination to simulation-based coordination marks a qualitative shift
in the structure of collective agency. In narrative civilizations, agency is exercised primarily through
persuasion, legitimacy is conferred through recognition, and action is mediated by institutions that
translate symbolic alignment into force. Collective outcomes depend on the ability of narratives to
mobilize belief and suppress complexity. In simulation civilizations, agency is exercised through
the exploration, maintenance, and revision of trajectories. Legitimacy emerges from demonstrated
viability under constraint, and action proceeds through the gradual scaling of conﬁgurations that
have proven robust within shared models.
This shift resolves a persistent tension in both political economy and philosophy of science.
Large-scale systems increasingly exhibit dynamics that defeat intuition, local reasoning, and linear
causal inference. Climate systems, technological ecosystems, and automated economies display
threshold eﬀects, hysteresis, and long-range coupling that render narrative explanation unreliable.
Attempts to govern such systems through discourse alone inevitably lag behind the dynamics
they seek to control, producing cycles of overconﬁdence, crisis, and retrospective rationalization.
Simulation does not eliminate uncertainty, but it localizes uncertainty within structured spaces
where sensitivity can be tested rather than asserted.
The reorganization of collective agency around simulation also reframes the meaning of planning.
Twentieth-century planning failures are often cited as evidence that large-scale foresight is impossible
or inherently authoritarian. Yet these failures were less a consequence of ambition than of epistemic
limitation.
Planners lacked the computational and representational tools required to explore
7

high-dimensional counterfactual spaces, and thus substituted rigid schemas for genuine constraint
navigation. Contemporary factory simulators demonstrate that this limitation no longer holds. The
same epistemic machinery that allows ﬁrms to design complex production systems can, in principle,
be generalized to social-scale questions without collapsing into centralized command.
The analogy to cosmology remains instructive. Penrose's critique of inﬂation is not that it
produces empirically incorrect predictions, but that it displaces explanation from deep structure to
contingent dynamics (Penrose 2010). RSVP's critique of expansion similarly targets explanatory
shortcuts that obscure entropy-driven organization. In the civic domain, narrative politics plays
an analogous role, oﬀering coherence without constraint. Simulation-based governance restores
explanation by forcing alignment between intent and consequence, replacing rhetorical plausibility
with structural admissibility.
Under this reorganization, collective agency becomes less about deciding what to believe and
more about deciding what to sustain. Futures are not chosen by vote alone but by the willingness
of participants to inhabit and develop trajectories whose costs and risks are explicit. Political
disagreement shifts from disputes over symbols to divergence in modeled commitments. Coordination
emerges not through consensus but through selective convergence on futures that remain viable
under continued exploration. In this sense, simulation civilizations do not abolish politics; they
relocate it to the space where structure, consequence, and responsibility intersect.

Architecture of Civic Simulation Systems
A civic simulation infrastructure must be understood not as a single monolithic model, but as a
layered architecture designed to accommodate heterogeneous forms of participation, uncertainty,
and scale. At its core lies a set of formally speciﬁed constraint models encoding physical, ecological,
economic, and institutional limits. These models must be explicit, inspectable, and revisable, since
their assumptions constitute the normative and epistemic substrate of the system. Unlike narrative
institutions, which obscure their assumptions behind rhetoric or tradition, simulation-based systems
surface their commitments as parameters and equations.
Above this core sits a trajectory engine responsible for propagating states forward under constraint.
This engine must support branching, rollback for analysis, and persistence for commitment. Crucially,
rollback is an analytic operation rather than a political one. While users may explore alternative
branches, trajectories that become socially instantiated accumulate irreversible history.
This
distinction preserves exploratory freedom without collapsing consequence.
Interface layers mediate access to this structure. A civic simulation cannot presume uniform
technical expertise. It must therefore support multiple representational modalities, ranging from
high-level narrative summaries to direct parameter manipulation and full model inspection. These
modalities are not separate systems but projections of a single underlying state space, ensuring that
accessibility does not entail epistemic fragmentation.
Veriﬁcation and validation occupy a distinct architectural role. Unlike predictive simulations
optimized for accuracy alone, civic simulations must be optimized for robustness under disagreement.
Validation therefore concerns not only empirical ﬁdelity but sensitivity transparency. Participants
must be able to see how outcomes depend on assumptions, which parameters dominate uncertainty,
and where models are fragile. This requirement distinguishes civic simulation from technocratic
forecasting and aligns it with democratic legitimacy grounded in intelligibility rather than authority.
Finally, governance of the simulation itself must be endogenous. Rules for modifying constraints,
introducing new modules, or deprecating outdated structures must be part of the simulated
institutional space rather than external interventions. This recursive design ensures that civic
8

simulation remains adaptive without reverting to narrative ﬁat, preserving alignment between
epistemic form and political function.
9
Historical Precedents and Failed Transitions
The proposal that simulation could function as civic infrastructure inevitably invites comparison
with earlier attempts to replace narrative or market coordination with formalized planning and
systems analysis. Twentieth-century history provides several instructive failures, most notably in
large-scale state planning, military systems analysis, and early cybernetic governance projects. These
failures are often cited as evidence that simulation-based coordination is inherently technocratic,
brittle, or politically illegitimate. Such conclusions, however, conﬂate epistemic ambition with
epistemic capacity.
Centralized planning eﬀorts such as those undertaken by Gosplan relied on static models, limited
computational power, and coarse abstractions that could not accommodate nonlinear dynamics
or rapid feedback.
Their failure was not due to the use of formal models per se, but to the
inability of those models to represent high-dimensional constraint spaces or to evolve in response to
unanticipated interactions. Similarly, mid-century systems analysis in military and policy contexts
often collapsed complex social dynamics into simpliﬁed optimization targets, producing brittle
strategies that failed outside narrowly deﬁned conditions.
What distinguishes contemporary simulation-native systems from these historical precedents
is not merely increased computational capacity, but a shift in epistemic orientation. Modern
simulations are exploratory rather than prescriptive. They are designed to expose sensitivity, failure
modes, and uncertainty rather than to produce singular optimal plans. This orientation aligns
simulation with experimental science rather than command-and-control governance. The simulation
does not dictate outcomes; it structures the space in which outcomes can be meaningfully explored.
The lesson of historical failure is therefore not that simulation is incompatible with civic
coordination, but that simulation cannot substitute for politics by collapsing value conﬂicts into
optimization targets.
Civic simulation, as proposed here, does not eliminate disagreement or
pluralism. Instead, it provides a medium in which disagreement can be expressed as divergence
among trajectories rather than as conﬂict over narratives. By learning from past failures, simulation
civilizations can avoid repeating the mistake of treating models as substitutes for judgment rather
than as instruments for its exercise.
10
Democratic Legitimacy in Simulation-Based Systems
Any proposal to reorganize civic coordination around simulation must confront the question of
democratic legitimacy. Traditional democratic theory grounds legitimacy in procedures of participa-
tion, deliberation, and consent, often emphasizing equality of voice and transparency of reasoning.
Simulation-based systems appear, at ﬁrst glance, to threaten these ideals by privileging technical
expertise and embedding decisions within complex models that are not immediately intelligible
to all participants. Addressing this concern requires a reconceptualization of legitimacy suited to
high-dimensional, path-dependent systems.
Legitimacy in simulation-based systems cannot rest solely on procedural equality in the expression
of opinion, because opinions detached from consequences lack epistemic weight. Instead, legitimacy
emerges from the availability of meaningful participation in consequence-bearing exploration. Par-
ticipants need not possess identical technical skills, but they must have access to representations
that allow them to understand how trajectories respond to constraints and interventions. Equality
9

is preserved not by uniformity of expertise, but by symmetry of access to the underlying structure
and to the capacity to contest its assumptions.
Deliberation does not disappear in such systems; it changes form. Rather than arguing primarily
about desired endpoints, participants deliberate about constraints, assumptions, and tolerable risks.
Public reasoning shifts from the exchange of justiﬁcations to the joint interrogation of models. This
form of deliberation satisﬁes the core demand of democratic publicity, since the reasons for outcomes
are embedded in visible structures rather than hidden in authority or rhetoric.
A common objection holds that simulation-based participation advantages technical elites and
risks reproducing existing power asymmetries. This objection is serious, but it applies with equal or
greater force to contemporary institutions whose technical substrates are already opaque, such as
ﬁnancial markets, algorithmic governance systems, and platform economies. Simulation-based civic
infrastructure, by contrast, makes its technical commitments explicit and contestable. Expertise
becomes accountable to structure rather than mystiﬁed through institutional prestige.
Legitimacy in this context is therefore epistemic rather than merely procedural. It depends on
whether participants can trace outcomes back to assumptions, understand the sources of disagreement,
and modify constraints through shared processes. Simulation does not replace democracy with
optimization; it redeﬁnes democratic participation as engagement with the structures that generate
futures rather than as assent to narratives about them.
11
Value Representation and Normative Constraints
A central challenge for any simulation-based civic infrastructure is the representation of values
without collapsing them into hidden technical assumptions. Critics of model-driven governance
have long noted that simulations inevitably encode normative commitments, whether explicitly
or implicitly, through their choice of variables, constraints, and evaluation criteria. The question
is therefore not whether values enter simulation, but how they are made legible, contestable, and
revisable within a shared civic framework.
In narrative institutions, values are typically expressed symbolically through slogans, platforms,
or moral claims whose practical implications remain underdetermined. Simulation forces a diﬀerent
mode of expression. Values appear as constraints on admissible trajectories, as protected invariants
that cannot be violated without terminating a branch, or as costs that must be explicitly borne
when tradeoﬀs are made. This translation does not eliminate ethical disagreement, but it relocates
it from the level of rhetoric to the level of structural consequence.
This relocation has important epistemic eﬀects. When values are encoded as constraints, their
interaction with physical and social limits becomes visible. Participants can observe not only whether
a value is aﬃrmed, but what it excludes, delays, or destabilizes. Ethical commitments thus acquire
a dynamic character, revealing tensions among goals that narrative discourse often suppresses.
Disagreement becomes productive rather than polarizing, because it manifests as divergence among
trajectories rather than as mutual negation.
Concerns about technocratic capture arise when value encoding is treated as a one-time design
decision rather than an ongoing civic process. A simulation-based infrastructure must therefore
include mechanisms for revising normative constraints through participation that is itself modeled
and persistent. Changes to value representations accumulate history and generate consequences,
preventing values from being rewritten opportunistically without acknowledgment of their eﬀects.
This persistence distinguishes civic simulation from both technocratic imposition and purely symbolic
ethics.
Importantly, the explicit encoding of values does not imply moral reductionism. Not all values
10

need to be quantiﬁable, and not all constraints need to be commensurable. Some commitments
may function as categorical exclusions rather than optimization targets. The key requirement is not
numerical precision, but structural clarity. Values must shape the space of possible futures in ways
that participants can inspect, challenge, and inhabit.
By making normative commitments explicit and consequence-bearing, simulation-based civic
infrastructure restores a connection between ethics and action that narrative coordination erodes.
Moral claims cease to function as identity markers or persuasive devices and instead become
architectural features of shared futures. In this way, simulation does not neutralize values; it gives
them durable form.
12
Objections, Limits, and Failure Modes
No proposal for simulation-based civic infrastructure is complete without addressing its potential
failure modes. Simulation does not confer epistemic immunity, and its misuse can reproduce or
amplify the very pathologies it is intended to correct. A rigorous account must therefore confront
the strongest objections directly, not as rhetorical hurdles, but as structural risks intrinsic to the
medium.
One such risk is the reality gap objection. All simulations are abstractions, and abstraction
necessarily excludes detail. If the excluded details systematically advantage certain groups or
assumptions, simulation can entrench bias under the guise of objectivity. This risk cannot be
eliminated, but it can be mitigated by enforcing transparency about model scope, uncertainty, and
sensitivity. Civic simulation must foreground not only outcomes but also where and why the model
may fail. Legitimacy depends on participants understanding the limits of representation, not on
believing in its completeness.
A second objection concerns manipulability. Any structured system can be gamed, and sim-
ulations are no exception. Participants may learn to exploit model artifacts rather than engage
substantively with constraints. However, this risk is not unique to simulation; it is endemic to all
institutional systems, including markets, elections, and bureaucracies. The distinguishing feature
of simulation is that exploitability itself becomes visible. When trajectories diverge sharply under
slight parameter changes, or when success depends on brittle assumptions, such fragility can be
exposed and corrected through model revision rather than concealed behind narrative justiﬁcation.
A third concern involves exclusion and cognitive inequality. Simulation literacy may become a
new form of gatekeeping, privileging those with technical training or cognitive resources. This danger
mirrors historical patterns in which new epistemic forms initially concentrate power. Addressing it
requires deliberate architectural design that supports progressive engagement, multiple representa-
tional layers, and collective scaﬀolding. Accessibility is not achieved by simplifying models beyond
usefulness, but by enabling participants to build understanding over time through interaction.
Finally, there is the risk of overreach. Simulation is not a substitute for lived experience, local
knowledge, or moral judgment. Certain domains resist formalization, and attempts to simulate them
exhaustively may produce false conﬁdence. A simulation-based civic infrastructure must therefore
coexist with, rather than eliminate, other forms of knowledge. Its role is to structure exploration
where complexity overwhelms narrative reasoning, not to colonize all domains of human judgment.
These objections do not invalidate the core thesis.
They clarify its conditions of success.
Simulation becomes a civic asset only when it is treated as a fallible, contestable, and evolving
medium rather than as an oracle. When its limits are acknowledged and incorporated into governance,
simulation can discipline power rather than concentrate it. When its limits are denied, it becomes
merely another narrative, albeit a more technical one.

Conclusion
The argument developed in this essay situates the rise of factory simulation, digital twins, and
counterfactual optimization within a broader intellectual movement that rejects narrative primitives
in favor of relational, constraint-driven structure. From Barbour's denial of fundamental time
to Penrose's elimination of absolute scale at cosmological boundaries and RSVP's treatment of
spacetime as an emergent record of irreversible entropy ﬂow, the trajectory is consistent. Explanation
advances by abandoning stories told against ﬁxed backgrounds and embracing models that expose
the geometry of possibility spaces and the costs of irreversibility.
Applied to social and economic systems, this trajectory implies that discourse-centric institu-
tions have reached their epistemic limits. As production becomes simulation-native, legitimacy
migrates away from institutions optimized for persuasion, engagement, and symbolic alignment
toward environments in which futures are explored rather than proclaimed. Education shifts from
narrative transmission to model navigation. Social media yields to shared simulation spaces where
preferences are revealed through sustained engagement with consequences. Collective choice moves
from rhetorical aggregation toward macrostructural selection among trajectories that demonstrate
robustness under explicit constraints.
This claim is not utopian, nor does it assume that simulation will produce consensus or eliminate
conﬂict. On the contrary, simulation foregrounds disagreement by making tradeoﬀs unavoidable
and divergence explicit. Its signiﬁcance lies not in harmonization but in intelligibility. It provides a
medium in which competing visions of the future can be developed, tested, and compared without
collapsing complexity into slogans or identity markers. In doing so, it binds preference expression to
responsibility, restoring a connection between belief and consequence that narrative coordination
systematically erodes.
The emergence of simulation as civic infrastructure is therefore not a matter of cultural pref-
erence or technological fashion. It is a structural response to the increasing dimensionality, path
dependence, and irreversibility of the systems societies must now govern. Just as cosmology could
not remain narrative once confronted with entropy, singularities, and scale invariance, societies
cannot remain narrative once confronted with planetary engineering, automated production, and
long-horizon technological trajectories. The replacement of narrative coordination with simulation-
based preference revelation marks a necessary reconﬁguration of collective agency, one in which
futures are not merely imagined, but inhabited, tested, and selectively sustained.

∄E−∆such that E−∆(γ) ∈ΓT−∆.
Deﬁne a partial order on equivalence classes by
[γ1] ≺[γ2] ⇐⇒S(γ1) < S(γ2),

for arbitrarily small ϵ > 0.
Under repeated application of B and K, the admissible trajectory space contracts onto a subset
Γ∗⊂Γ

This contraction deﬁnes a ﬁxed-point structure in trajectory space corresponding to stabilized
macrostructural commitment.

A macrostructure is stable if
Λ(A) ≤0,
and unstable otherwise.
Let M denote the set of all macrostructural ﬁxed points. The partially ordered set
(M, ≺)
induced by entropy ordering deﬁnes a hierarchy of viable futures.
Selection among macrostructures corresponds to convergence of collective trajectories into a
particular basin of attraction under repeated application of T .
F
Collective Coupling, Coherence, and Multi-Agent Trajectories
Let {Γ(i)}N
i=1 denote the trajectory spaces associated with N agents, each deﬁned over a common
admissible manifold M.
Deﬁne the joint trajectory space as the Cartesian product

N
Y
i=1
Γ(i).
16

Let
γ(N)(t) = (γ(1)(t), . . . , γ(N)(t))
denote a collective trajectory.
Introduce an interaction operator
I : Γ(N) →R≥0
measuring coupling strength among agents along a trajectory.
Assume I satisﬁes symmetry and non-negativity:
I(γ(N)) = I(π(γ(N))),
I ≥0
for any permutation π of agent indices.
Deﬁne collective entropy as
S(N)(γ(N)) =
N

 = 0.
A collective macrostructure is deﬁned as a ﬁxed point of the induced transition operator on Γ(N)
under coupling, entropy accumulation, and commitment.
Such macrostructures characterize coherent, stable collective futures emergent from interacting
agent trajectories.
17

G
Uncertainty Propagation and Robustness Criteria
Let Γ denote the space of admissible trajectories on the manifold M, and let Θ be a parameter
space encoding uncertain model inputs.
Assume a parametrized family of dynamics
Dθ : Γ →Γ
for θ ∈Θ.
Deﬁne a probability measure µ on Θ representing epistemic uncertainty.
For a trajectory γ ∈Γ, deﬁne the uncertainty envelope
U(γ) = {Dθ(γ) | θ ∈Θ}.
Let Π : Γ →R ∪{−∞} be a preference functional. Deﬁne the worst-case valuation
Πmin(γ) = inf
θ∈Θ Π(Dθ(γ)),
and the expected valuation
Eµ[Π(γ)] =
Z
Θ
Π(Dθ(γ)) dµ(θ).
Deﬁne a robustness functional
R(γ) = λΠmin(γ) + (1 −λ)Eµ[Π(γ)],
0 ≤λ ≤1.
A trajectory γ∗is said to be robustly admissible if
R(γ∗) ≥R(γ)
∀γ ∈Γ.
Deﬁne robustness dominance between trajectories by
γ1 ≻R γ2 ⇐⇒R(γ1) > R(γ2).
A macrostructure A ⊂Γ is robust if
inf
γ∈A R(γ) ≥sup
γ /∈A
R(γ).
Let MR ⊂M denote the set of robust macrostructural ﬁxed points.
Selection under uncertainty corresponds to convergence of collective trajectories into MR under
repeated application of the transition operator with stochastic parameter realization.
This criterion ensures that selected futures are stable not only under known constraints but
under admissible uncertainty in model structure and parameters.
H
Simulation Depth, Resolution Limits, and Coarse-Graining
Let M be an admissible manifold equipped with a family of projections
{πℓ: M →Mℓ}ℓ∈N
indexed by simulation resolution level ℓ, where higher ℓcorresponds to ﬁner structural detail.
18

Assume each Mℓis a quotient space of M under an equivalence relation ∼ℓsatisfying
s1 ∼ℓs2 =⇒s1 ∼ℓ′ s2
∀ℓ′ < ℓ.
Deﬁne the coarse-grained trajectory at level ℓas
γℓ= πℓ◦γ.
Let Γℓdenote the space of admissible trajectories in Mℓ.
Deﬁne a resolution-consistent preference functional
Πℓ: Γℓ→R ∪{−∞}
such that for any γ ∈Γ,
Πℓ(γℓ) →Π(γ)
as ℓ→∞.
Deﬁne resolution error
εℓ(γ) = |Π(γ) −Πℓ(γℓ)|.
A trajectory γ is said to be resolution-stable if
lim
ℓ→∞εℓ(γ) = 0.
Deﬁne the simulation depth of a trajectory as
D(γ) = inf{ℓ| εℓ(γ) < δ}
for ﬁxed tolerance δ > 0.
Let Γδ denote the set of trajectories admitting ﬁnite simulation depth.
Macrostructures A ⊂Γ are resolution-invariant if
∀γ ∈A,
γ ∈Γδ and
sup
ℓ≥D(γ)
εℓ(γ) < δ.
Such macrostructures persist under coarse-graining and deﬁne futures whose preference ordering
is stable across simulation resolutions.
This establishes a formal criterion for when civic-scale simulations remain meaningful despite
ﬁnite computational resources and unavoidable abstraction.
I
Interoperability, Modular Composition, and Constraint Gluing
Let {Mi}i∈I be a family of admissible manifolds, each equipped with its own constraint map
Φi : Mi →Rki.
Deﬁne overlap regions Mij ⊂Mi × Mj together with compatibility maps
ψij : Mij →Mj,
ψji : Mij →Mi,
satisfying cocycle conditions
ψik = ψjk ◦ψij
on triple overlaps.
19

The global admissible space is deﬁned as the glued manifold
M =
G
i∈I
Mi
 ∼
where x ∼ψij(x) for all x ∈Mij.
Let Γi denote the admissible trajectory space on Mi. Deﬁne the global trajectory space
Γ =
n
γ | γ|Ui ∈Γi and γ|Uij is compatible under ψij
o
.
Deﬁne local preference functionals
Πi : Γi →R ∪{−∞}.
A global preference functional exists if there is a map
Π : Γ →R ∪{−∞}
such that
Π(γ) =
X
i∈I
Πi(γ|Ui)
and compatibility constraints enforce
Πi(γi) = Πj(γj)
on overlaps.
Deﬁne a modular simulation as a tuple
({Mi}, {Φi}, {Πi}, {ψij})
satisfying global admissibility and preference coherence.
A modular macrostructure is a ﬁxed point of the induced transition operator on Γ invariant
under restriction to all submodules.
This formalism deﬁnes interoperability as constraint-preserving gluing rather than interface-
level compatibility, ensuring that composite simulations preserve admissibility, irreversibility, and
preference ordering across scales.
J
Limit Objects, Convergence, and Asymptotic Futures
Let {Γn}n∈N be a directed system of admissible trajectory spaces indexed by simulation horizon,
resolution, or institutional scope, with connecting maps
ρn,m : Γm →Γn
for m ≥n,
satisfying ρn,n = id and ρn,k = ρn,m ◦ρm,k for all k ≥m ≥n.
Deﬁne the inverse limit trajectory space
Γ∞= lim
←−Γn = {(γn)n∈N | ρn,m(γm) = γn ∀m ≥n} .
Let Πn : Γn →R ∪{−∞} be compatible preference functionals such that
Πn(ρn,m(γm)) = Πm(γm)
∀m ≥n.
20

Deﬁne the asymptotic preference functional
Π∞: Γ∞→R ∪{−∞},
Π∞((γn)) = lim
n→∞Πn(γn),
whenever the limit exists.
A sequence (γn) is said to be convergent if Π∞((γn)) exists and is ﬁnite.
Deﬁne an asymptotic future as an equivalence class
F ⊂Γ∞
such that all (γn) ∈F are preference-equivalent under Π∞.
Introduce an asymptotic transition operator
T∞: Γ∞→Γ∞
induced by the compatible family {Tn} on each Γn.
An asymptotic future F is stable if
T∞((γn)) ∈F
∀(γn) ∈F.
Let F denote the set of all stable asymptotic futures. The partially ordered set (F, ≺) induced
by Π∞deﬁnes the terminal hierarchy of futures under unbounded simulation depth and horizon.
Convergence of collective simulation corresponds to selection of an element of F under reﬁnement
of resolution, extension of horizon, and accumulation of irreversible commitments.
K
Computational Tractability, Approximation, and Feasible Se-
lection
Let Γ denote the admissible trajectory space endowed with a metric dΓ and preference functional Π.
Deﬁne the exact selection problem as
γ∗∈arg max
γ∈Γ Π(γ).
Assume that exact maximization over Γ is intractable. Introduce a family of approximation
operators
Aϵ : Γ →Γϵ ⊂Γ
indexed by tolerance ϵ > 0, such that
sup
γ∈Γ
inf
˜γ∈Γϵ dΓ(γ, ˜γ) ≤ϵ.
Deﬁne the approximate preference functional
Πϵ(˜γ) = Π(˜γ),
˜γ ∈Γϵ.
An ϵ-optimal trajectory ˜γ∗satisﬁes
Πϵ(˜γ∗) ≥sup
˜γ∈Γϵ
Πϵ(˜γ) −ϵ.
21

Deﬁne feasible selection consistency by
lim
ϵ→0 Π(˜γ∗
ϵ ) = sup
γ∈Γ
Π(γ),
where ˜γ∗
ϵ is any ϵ-optimal trajectory.
Introduce a complexity functional
κ(ϵ) = inf{|Γϵ| | Aϵ satisﬁes the approximation bound}.
A simulation architecture is tractable if
κ(ϵ) = O(ϵ−p)
for some ﬁnite p > 0.
Deﬁne a macrostructure A to be computationally realizable if
∃ϵn →0
such that
˜γ∗
ϵn ∈A for all suﬃciently large n.
Thus selection among macrostructures is feasible when preference-optimal trajectories are stable
under controlled approximation and bounded computational growth.
This criterion separates simulable futures from those that exist only as formal optima in
intractable trajectory spaces.
L
Information Flow, Observability, and Identiﬁability
Let (Γ, F) be a measurable space of admissible trajectories, where F is a σ-algebra generated by
trajectory segments.
For each time T > 0, deﬁne the preﬁx projection
πT : Γ →ΓT ,
and let FT = π−1
T (B(ΓT )) denote the induced σ-algebra of observable events up to T.
An observation operator is a measurable map
OT : Γ →YT ,
where (YT , GT ) is an observation space with σ-algebra GT .
Deﬁne the observable σ-algebra
HT = O−1
T (GT ) ⊆FT .
Let Π : Γ →R ∪{−∞} be a preference functional.
Two trajectories γ1, γ2 are observationally equivalent at horizon T if
OT (γ1) = OT (γ2).
Deﬁne the identiﬁability condition:
γ1 ̸= γ2
⇒
∃T > 0 such that E[Π(γ1) | HT ] ̸= E[Π(γ2) | HT ].
A simulation system is preference-identiﬁable if the above condition holds almost surely with
respect to any admissible uncertainty measure on Γ.
22

Deﬁne the information gain functional
IT (γ) = Var
 Π(γ)
 −Var
 Π(γ) | HT
.
Preference revelation is asymptotically observable if
lim
T→∞IT (γ) > 0
for all non-equivalent γ ∈Γ.
This establishes observability as a necessary condition for meaningful simulation-based preference
selection.
M
Strategic Misrepresentation and Incentive Compatibility
Let Γ(i) denote the admissible trajectory space associated with agent i, and let Π(i) : Γ(i) →R∪{−∞}
be the true preference functional of agent i.
Deﬁne a reported preference functional
bΠ(i) = R(i)(Π(i)),
where R(i) is a reporting operator chosen by agent i.
Let bΓ denote the trajectory space induced by the aggregation of reported preferences {bΠ(i)}
through a collective selection operator K.
The induced realized trajectory is
γ∗= K({bΠ(i)}).
Deﬁne the realized utility of agent i as
U(i) = Π(i)(γ∗).
A deviation R(i) →eR(i) is proﬁtable if
Π(i) K( eR(i)(Π(i)), bΠ(−i))
 > Π(i) K(bΠ(i), bΠ(−i))
.
The simulation mechanism is incentive compatible if no proﬁtable deviation exists for any agent
i.
Deﬁne trajectory-dominant strategy truthfulness by
R(i) = id
is dominant for all i.
A weaker equilibrium notion is trajectory Nash equilibrium, where
∀i,
U(i)(R(i), R(−i)) ≥U(i)( eR(i), R(−i)).
Incentive compatibility under irreversibility is strengthened by requiring that misrepresentation
induces entropy increase:
S(γ∗
misrep) > S(γ∗
truthful).
Such mechanisms penalize strategic distortion through irreversible trajectory degradation rather
than explicit sanctions.
23

N
Learning Dynamics and Belief Updating
Let Θ be a parameter space indexing uncertain model components, and let µ0 be an initial belief
measure over Θ.
For each θ ∈Θ, let Dθ denote the induced trajectory dynamics on Γ.
Deﬁne the belief state at iteration n as a probability measure µn on Θ.
Given an observed trajectory segment γ|[0,Tn], deﬁne the likelihood
L(θ | γ|[0,Tn])
measurable with respect to the observation σ-algebra HTn.
Belief updating proceeds via the operator
µn+1(A) =
R
A L(θ | γ|[0,Tn]) dµn(θ)
R
Θ L(θ | γ|[0,Tn]) dµn(θ)
for measurable A ⊆Θ.
Deﬁne belief entropy
H(µn) = −
Z
Θ
log µn(θ) dµn(θ).
Learning convergence occurs if
lim
n→∞H(µn) = H∗
for some ﬁnite H∗.
Deﬁne beliefâĂŞtrajectory coherence by
lim
n→∞
sup
θ∈supp(µn)
dΓ
 Dθ(γ), γ
 = 0.
A learning process is stable if belief convergence implies robustness convergence:
µn →µ∗
⇒
γ∗
n →γ∗,
where γ∗
n is the selected trajectory under µn.
This formalizes learning as convergence of belief measures coupled to stabilization of preferred
trajectories under repeated simulation exposure.
O
Symmetry, Equivalence, and Quotienting of Futures
Let Γ be the admissible trajectory space and let G be a group acting on Γ via
α : G × Γ →Γ,
(g, γ) 7→g · γ,
such that admissibility and entropy accumulation are preserved:
γ ∈Γ ⇒g · γ ∈Γ,
S(g · γ) = S(γ).
Deﬁne trajectory equivalence under symmetry by
γ1 ∼G γ2 ⇐⇒∃g ∈G such that γ2 = g · γ1.
24

Let the quotient space of futures be
Γ/G = Γ/ ∼G .
Assume the preference functional Π is G-invariant:
Π(g · γ) = Π(γ)
∀g ∈G.
Then Π induces a well-deﬁned functional
Π : Γ/G →R ∪{−∞}.
Deﬁne macrostructures on the quotient as equivalence classes
A ⊂Γ/G
that are ﬁxed points of the induced transition operator T .
Two macrostructures A1, A2 ⊂Γ are gauge-equivalent if
A2 = g · A1
for some g ∈G.
Let M/G denote the set of inequivalent macrostructures modulo symmetry.
Selection among futures is said to be symmetry-reduced if convergence occurs in M/G rather
than in M.
This formalism eliminates redundancy arising from relabeling, scaling, or institutional isomor-
phism, ensuring that distinct selected futures correspond to genuinely distinct macrostructural
regimes.
P
Catastrophic Boundaries, Absorbing States, and No-Return
Sets
Let Γ be the admissible trajectory space with entropy functional S and preference functional Π.
Deﬁne a catastrophic boundary as a subset
X ⊂Γ
such that for any trajectory γ ∈X,
∀∆> 0,
Π(E∆(γ)) = −∞,
where E∆denotes the irreversible extension operator.
A trajectory γ is catastrophic if
∃T such that γ|[0,T] ∈X.
Deﬁne the absorbing set
Aabs = {γ ∈Γ | ∀∆> 0, E∆(γ) = γ},
where entropy accumulation satisﬁes
S(E∆(γ)) = S(γ).
25

Deﬁne a no-return set
N ⊂Γ
such that
γ ∈N
⇒
∄γ′ ≺γ
under the entropy-induced partial order.
Deﬁne the catastrophe operator
C : Γ →{0, 1}
where C(γ) = 1 if γ intersects X.
A preference functional is catastrophe-aware if
Π(γ) = −∞
∀γ such that C(γ) = 1.
Deﬁne the safe admissible space
Γsafe = Γ \ X.
A macrostructure A is viable if
A ⊂Γsafe
and
T (A) ⊂Γsafe.
Selection dynamics constrained to Γsafe ensure that catastrophic trajectories are excluded prior to
preference comparison, enforcing existential constraints independently of optimization or aggregation.
This formalizes irreversible existential risk as a boundary condition in trajectory space rather
than as a tradeable cost.
Q
Continuum Limits, Discretization Independence, and Renor-
malization
Let {Γ∆t}∆t>0 be a family of admissible trajectory spaces indexed by time discretization scale ∆t,
where each Γ∆t consists of piecewise-constant or piecewise-smooth trajectories with timestep ∆t.
Assume reﬁnement maps
r∆t,∆t′ : Γ∆t →Γ∆t′
for ∆t′ < ∆t
satisfying consistency conditions
r∆t′,∆t′′ ◦r∆t,∆t′ = r∆t,∆t′′.
Deﬁne the continuum trajectory space as the direct limit
Γ0 = lim
−→
∆t→0
Γ∆t.
Let Π∆t : Γ∆t →R ∪{−∞} be discretized preference functionals.
Discretization consistency requires
lim
∆t→0 Π∆t(r∆t,0(γ∆t)) = Π0(γ)
∀γ ∈Γ0.
Deﬁne discretization error
δ∆t(γ) =
Π0(γ) −Π∆t(r0,∆t(γ))
 .
26

A preference ordering is discretization-independent if
lim
∆t→0 sup
γ1,γ2
 Π∆t(γ1) −Π∆t(γ2)
 −
 Π0(γ1) −Π0(γ2)
 = 0.
Introduce a renormalization operator
Rλ : Γ0 →Γ0
representing coarse-graining by factor λ > 1.
A macrostructure A is renormalization-invariant if
Rλ(A) = A
∀λ > 1.
Let MRG ⊂M denote the set of renormalization-invariant macrostructures.
These macrostructures deﬁne futures whose preference ordering, stability, and admissibility
persist under reﬁnement of temporal resolution, agent granularity, and simulation timestep, ensuring
that selection is not an artifact of discretization.
This establishes continuum robustness as a necessary condition for civic-scale simulation validity.
R
Domain Instantiation via Parametric Constraint Specialization
Let M be a global admissible manifold equipped with constraint map
Φ : M →Rk.
Let D be a domain index set. For each domain d ∈D, deﬁne a specialization operator
Σd : M →Md
together with induced constraint map
Φd = Φ ◦Σ−1
d .
The domain-admissible manifold is
Md = {sd ∈Md | Φd(sd) = 0}.
Let Γd denote the admissible trajectory space over Md.
Deﬁne the lifting operator
Ld : Γd →Γ
such that
Σd ◦Ld = idΓd.
A domain is said to be faithful if
Πd(γd) = Π(Ld(γd))
∀γd ∈Γd,
where Πd is the induced domain preference functional.
Deﬁne a domain instantiation as the tuple
(Md, Γd, Φd, Πd).
27

Two domains d1, d2 ∈D are structurally equivalent if there exists a diﬀeomorphism
ϕ : Md1 →Md2
such that
Φd2 ◦ϕ = Φd1,
Πd2(ϕ ◦γ) = Πd1(γ).
Let D/∼denote the quotient of domains under structural equivalence.
A macrostructure A is domain-invariant if
∀d ∈D,
∃Ad ⊂Γd
such that
Ld(Ad) ⊂A.
This establishes domain instantiation as constraint-preserving specialization rather than ad hoc
model construction.
S
A Functorial and Categorical Formulation
Deﬁne a category Sim whose objects are simulation systems
S = (M, Γ, Φ, Π, S),
where M is an admissible manifold, Γ its trajectory space, Φ a constraint map, Π a preference
functional, and S an entropy functional.
A morphism
f : S1 →S2
consists of a pair (fM, fΓ) such that
fM : M1 →M2,
fΓ : Γ1 →Γ2,
with the following compatibility conditions:
Φ2 ◦fM = Φ1,
Π2 ◦fΓ = Π1,
S2 ◦fΓ = S1.
Let Dom ⊂Sim be the full subcategory of domain-instantiated systems.
Deﬁne a functor
F : Dom →Pref
to the category Pref whose objects are ordered sets (X, ⪯) and whose morphisms preserve order.
For each S ∈Dom,
F(S) = (Γ/∼Π, ⪯),
where ∼Π denotes preference equivalence.
Deﬁne a second functor
E : Sim →Poset
mapping each simulation to its entropy-ordered quotient space
E(S) = (Γ/∼S, ≺).
A simulation system is coherent if the diagram
Sim@ > F >> Pref@V EV V @V V UV Poset@ >> ι > Pref
28

commutes up to natural isomorphism, where ι is the forgetful functor.
Deﬁne the macrostructure functor
Mac : Sim →Set
by
Mac(S) = M,
the set of macrostructural ﬁxed points of S.
A simulation civilization corresponds to a terminal object
S∗∈Sim
such that for any S there exists a unique morphism
S →S∗
preserving admissibility, entropy ordering, and preference equivalence.
Such a terminal object represents a maximally reﬁned, resolution-independent, domain-complete
simulation infrastructure in which all admissible futures factor through a common macrostructural
selection space.
This categorical formulation uniﬁes constraint geometry, trajectory dynamics, irreversibility,
preference revelation, and domain specialization into a single abstract object, establishing simulation
as a universal coordination medium independent of narrative representation.
T
Sheaf-Theoretic Localization and Gluing of Futures
Let M be an admissible manifold equipped with a topology τ generated by constraint-compatible
open sets.
For each open set U ⊂M, deﬁne a local simulation system
S(U) = (M|U, Γ(U), Φ|U, Π|U, S|U),
where Γ(U) denotes admissible trajectories whose image lies entirely in U.
Deﬁne a presheaf
S : Open(M)op →Sim
assigning to each open set its local simulation system and to each inclusion
V ⊆U
a restriction morphism
ρU,V : S(U) →S(V ).
The presheaf S is a sheaf if for any open cover {Ui} of U and any compatible family of local
trajectories
{γi ∈Γ(Ui)}
satisfying
ρUi,Uij(γi) = ρUj,Uij(γj)
on overlaps Uij,
there exists a unique global trajectory
γ ∈Γ(U)
29

such that
ρU,Ui(γ) = γi
∀i.
Deﬁne the sheaf of macrostructures
Mac(U) = M(U),
where M(U) denotes the set of macrostructural ﬁxed points of S(U).
A global macrostructure A ∈M(M) exists if and only if the family
{Ai ∈M(Ui)}
is compatible under restriction on overlaps and admits a unique gluing.
Deﬁne an obstruction class
ω ∈H1(M, Mac)
measuring failure of local macrostructures to glue globally.
Vanishing of ω is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for coherent global futures to emerge from
locally admissible dynamics.
This establishes that global civic futures are not primitive objects but sections of a sheaf of
simulations, existing only when local constraint satisfactions are mutually compatible.
U
Homotopy of Futures and Equivalence of Trajectories
Let Γ be the admissible trajectory space endowed with a topology induced by the metric dΓ and
constrained by admissibility and entropy monotonicity.
Deﬁne a homotopy between two trajectories γ0, γ1 ∈Γ as a continuous map
H : [0, 1] × [0, T] →M
such that
H(0, t) = γ0(t),
H(1, t) = γ1(t),
and for all s ∈[0, 1], the path
γs(t) = H(s, t)
lies in Γ.
A homotopy is admissible if
C(γs(t)) = 1
and
d
dtS(γs|[0,t]) ≥0
∀s, t.
Two trajectories are homotopy-equivalent if there exists an admissible homotopy between them.
Deﬁne the homotopy class of a trajectory as
[γ]∼H = {γ′ ∈Γ | γ′ ∼H γ}.
Let ΓH = Γ/ ∼H denote the space of homotopy classes.
Deﬁne the catastrophic exclusion condition: a homotopy H is forbidden if
∃s, t such that H(s, t) ∈X,
where X is the catastrophic boundary set.
30

Homotopy classes are therefore deﬁned relative to Γsafe = Γ \ X.
Assume the preference functional Π is homotopy-invariant:
Π(γ0) = Π(γ1)
if
γ0 ∼H γ1.
Then Π descends to a well-deﬁned functional
eΠ : ΓH →R ∪{−∞}.
Deﬁne a future type as a connected component of ΓH.
Let π0(Γsafe) denote the set of path-connected components under admissible homotopy.
Two macrostructures A1, A2 are future-equivalent if
∀γ1 ∈A1, ∃γ2 ∈A2
such that
[γ1]∼H = [γ2]∼H.
The set of inequivalent futures is therefore classiﬁed by
π0(Γsafe).
This homotopy classiﬁcation establishes that distinct futures are separated not by preference
magnitude alone, but by topological obstructions in trajectory space, identifying civilizational
transitions as crossings between homotopy classes that cannot be achieved without violating
existential constraints.
