Physics After Spacetime
Deriving Physical Law from Irreversible Entropy Flow

February 1, 2026
Abstract
Modern theoretical physics is organized around geometric primitives. Spacetime manifolds,
metric structure, symmetry groups, and action principles are typically taken as ontological starting
points, with dynamics introduced as laws operating upon an already-given arena. Despite its
empirical successes, this strategy has repeatedly encountered conceptual tension in regimes
involving gravitation, quantum measurement, irreversibility, and the status of time. In particular,
attempts to resolve these tensions often proceed by further geometric elaboration, introducing
additional dimensions, extended conﬁguration spaces, or increasingly abstract kinematical
structures whose physical necessity remains unclear.
This essay develops an alternative derivational program in which geometry, force, and
probabilistic law are not fundamental, but emerge from a deeper thermodynamic substrate
governed by irreversible entropy ﬂow and constraint relaxation. The framework employed is
the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP), a ﬁeld-theoretic ontology in which physical
phenomena arise from the coupled dynamics of a scalar constraint ﬁeld, a vector transport ﬁeld,
and an entropy density. Within this setting, spacetime geometry is reconstructed as an eﬀective
description of stabilized ﬂow regimes rather than posited a priori, while time itself appears as
an emergent translation generated by irreversible ﬁeld evolution rather than as a dimensional
coordinate.
We show that a wide class of familiar physical theories can be recovered from RSVP as
controlled limits, coarse-grainings, or gauge-ﬁxed projections. Classical mechanics arises in
regimes of slow entropy descent where history dependence becomes negligible. Relativistic
structure appears through ﬂow-aligned constraint propagation without invoking expanding
spacetime. Gravitational dynamics emerge as entropy-driven relaxation rather than fundamental
curvature, subsuming existing thermodynamic gravity proposals as partial projections. Gauge
redundancy and action principles are reinterpreted as bookkeeping devices encoding constraint
consistency, while quantum-like probabilistic descriptions arise when ﬁne-grained irreversible
history is inaccessible. Higher-order and quadratic curvature theories are shown to function
as interface descriptions required by coarse-grained stability rather than as candidates for
fundamental ontology.
By deriving physical law from irreversible entropy ﬂow rather than geometric primitives,
this work proposes a reorganization of foundational physics in which spacetime is no longer
primary but contingent. The result is not a rejection of established theory, but an explanatory
compression in which disparate physical regimes are uniﬁed as expressions of a single entropic,
constraint-based substrate.

Introduction: From Geometry to Constraint
The dominant unifying strategy in modern physics has been geometric. From Newtonian absolute
space through Einsteinian spacetime and onward to gauge-theoretic formulations of the Standard
Model, physical law has been expressed as dynamics deﬁned on an underlying geometric arena. Fields
evolve on manifolds, particles trace worldlines, and forces are encoded as curvature, connection, or
symmetry breaking. This geometric orientation has proven extraordinarily powerful, yielding precise
empirical predictions across vast ranges of scale. Yet it has also imposed a distinctive ontological
commitment: that geometry itself constitutes the primitive substrate of physical reality.
This commitment has become increasingly strained in foundational contexts. In gravitation,
the identiﬁcation of geometry with dynamical degrees of freedom blurs the distinction between
background and content, leading to conceptual diﬃculties in deﬁning energy, locality, and quantiza-
tion. In quantum theory, the geometric language of Hilbert space and conﬁguration space obscures
the role of irreversibility and measurement, forcing probabilistic postulates that sit uneasily beside
time-reversal-invariant dynamics. In cosmology, geometric expansion is invoked to explain large-scale
structure and redshift, while the thermodynamic arrow of time remains only partially integrated
into the formalism. Across these domains, geometry functions simultaneously as description and
explanation, a dual role that becomes unstable when pushed beyond the regimes in which it was
originally motivated.
Responses to these tensions have often taken the form of further geometric elaboration. Additional
dimensions are introduced to unify interactions or encode scale separation. Extended phase spaces
and higher-order curvature terms are proposed to regularize ultraviolet behavior. Abstract symmetry
structures are promoted to fundamental status in the hope that dynamics will follow from kinematics
alone. While mathematically sophisticated, such strategies risk ontological inﬂation, multiplying
structural assumptions without clarifying their physical necessity. The repeated introduction of new
geometric degrees of freedom suggests that geometry may be serving as a representational scaﬀold
rather than as a genuinely fundamental constituent.
An alternative approach begins by reversing the explanatory order. Rather than asking how
dynamics unfold within a given geometric arena, one may ask under what conditions geometric
descriptions become valid at all. This shift treats geometry not as primitive, but as emergent from
deeper organizing principles. Thermodynamics provides a natural candidate for such a reorientation.
Unlike geometry, entropy and irreversibility are not optional features of physical description; they
are ubiquitous constraints on real processes. Every interaction leaves traces, dissipates structure,
and restricts future evolution. The arrow of time is not imposed by boundary conditions alone, but
is encoded in the very possibility of stable records and causal ordering.
From this perspective, physical law is better understood as a family of stabilized constraint
regimes arising from irreversible entropy ﬂow. Laws do not govern evolution from outside the
system; they summarize regularities that persist once certain patterns of dissipation, transport, and
constraint alignment have settled into repeatable form. Geometry, symmetry, and even probability
then appear as eﬀective bookkeeping structures that become valid only after this stabilization has
occurred. Their apparent fundamentality reﬂects the robustness of the regimes they describe, not
their ontological priority.

The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework is constructed explicitly along these
lines. It posits no fundamental spacetime arena beyond a minimal diﬀerentiable manifold suﬃcient
to support ﬁeld relations. Instead, physical structure arises from the coupled dynamics of a scalar
constraint ﬁeld Φ, a vector transport ﬁeld v, and an entropy density S. The scalar ﬁeld encodes
constraint topology, the vector ﬁeld mediates directed transport and torsion, and the entropy
ﬁeld enforces irreversibility through monotonic growth. Dynamics are governed not by variational
extremization on a ﬁxed background, but by entropy descent and constraint relaxation, ensuring
that evolution is intrinsically history-dependent.
Within RSVP, familiar physical theories are recovered not by postulation but by reduction.
Classical mechanics emerges when entropy gradients are small and the inﬂuence of prior history can
be neglected. Relativistic structure appears when constraint propagation aligns with transport ﬂow,
producing eﬀective causal cones without invoking expanding spacetime. Gravitational phenomena
arise as collective entropy-driven relaxation of constraint curvature, subsuming metric descriptions
as secondary summaries. Quantum-like probabilistic behavior appears when irreversible microhistory
is inaccessible, forcing coarse-grained descriptions that trade determinism for statistical consistency.
The aim of this essay is to make this derivational structure explicit. Rather than proposing
RSVP as a competing theory among others, we treat it as a generative substrate from which multiple
physical formalisms can be obtained as limits, projections, or interfaces. In doing so, we argue that
many of the conceptual diﬃculties facing contemporary physics arise not from incomplete geometry,
but from the assumption that geometry must come ﬁrst. Physics after spacetime is not physics
without rigor, but physics reorganized around the only features that never disappear: entropy,
irreversibility, and constraint.

The RSVP Substrate:
Entropy, Constraint, and Irreversible
Dynamics
The RSVP framework begins from a minimal ontological commitment: that physical description
requires relational structure suﬃcient to encode interaction, but not a pre-speciﬁed geometric arena
endowed with metric or causal signiﬁcance. Formally, one assumes a smooth four-dimensional
manifold M only as a carrier for ﬁelds and their relations, without interpreting its coordinates as
physically privileged. All substantive structure arises from the behavior of three coupled ﬁelds
deﬁned on M: a scalar constraint ﬁeld Φ : M →R, a vector transport ﬁeld v ∈Γ(TM), and an
entropy density ﬁeld S : M →R≥0. These ﬁelds are not introduced as independent degrees of
freedom in a Lagrangian sense, but as complementary aspects of a single thermodynamic system
whose evolution is intrinsically irreversible.
The scalar ﬁeld Φ encodes constraint topology. Regions of high scalar curvature correspond
to tightly constrained conﬁgurations, while ﬂatter regions represent relaxed or weakly constrained
regimes.
Unlike a potential energy in classical mechanics, Φ does not merely bias motion; it
determines which conﬁgurations are dynamically accessible at all. The vector ﬁeld v represents
directed transport within this constraint landscape, mediating the redistribution of structure and
the propagation of inﬂuence. Its vorticity and divergence encode torsional and compressive eﬀects
3

that cannot be reduced to scalar gradients alone. The entropy ﬁeld S enforces irreversibility by
monotonically increasing along admissible trajectories, ensuring that evolution cannot be reversed
without violating the fundamental thermodynamic ordering of states.
Dynamics in RSVP are governed by coupled nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations that balance
transport, diﬀusion, and entropy production. A representative form, suﬃcient for the derivations
that follow, is given by
∂tΦ + v · ∇Φ = −γS + λ∇2Φ,
(1)
∂tv + (v · ∇)v = −∇Φ + κ(∇× v) + ν∇2v,
(2)
∂tS = α|∇Φ|2 + β|v|2 −δ∇· v,
(3)
where the coeﬃcients γ, λ, κ, ν, α, β, and δ parameterize dissipation, smoothing, torsion coupling,
and entropy production. These equations are not postulated as fundamental laws in the traditional
sense, but as the simplest closure consistent with transport, constraint relaxation, and monotonic
entropy growth. Importantly, they do not derive from a time-reversal-invariant action principle.
Irreversibility is built in at the level of ﬁeld evolution rather than imposed through boundary
conditions.
A central consequence of this structure is that history cannot be erased. The state of the system
at a given point on M encodes not only local ﬁeld values but also the cumulative eﬀects of prior
entropy production and constraint relaxation. This distinguishes RSVP sharply from conservative
ﬁeld theories, where instantaneous state fully determines both past and future evolution. In RSVP,
the past constrains the future asymmetrically, and this asymmetry is not an emergent approximation
but a deﬁning feature of the ontology.
Despite this irreversibility, stable regimes do arise. Under appropriate conditions, the coupled
dynamics admit attractor structures in which entropy production is locally minimized subject to
global constraints. In such regimes, the scalar ﬁeld approaches conﬁgurations satisfying
∇2Φ + κS ≈0,
(4)
while transport aligns with constraint gradients, v ∥∇Φ, up to torsional corrections.
These
attractors function as eﬀective vacua, around which perturbative descriptions become possible. It is
within these stabilized regimes that geometric and kinematic notions familiar from conventional
physics emerge.
Crucially, nothing in the RSVP substrate presupposes metric structure, light cones, or temporal
coordinates as fundamental. The manifold M provides a relational scaﬀold, but causal ordering,
duration, and simultaneity are not encoded geometrically at the outset. Instead, they arise when the
alignment of constraint gradients, transport ﬂow, and entropy production becomes suﬃciently regular
to support consistent ordering relations. Time, in particular, does not appear as an independent
variable in the ontology, but as a derived parameter indexing irreversible translation through ﬁeld
conﬁguration space. The formalization of this emergent temporal structure will be addressed only
after the derivation of classical and relativistic regimes, emphasizing that time itself is downstream
of more primitive thermodynamic organization.

By grounding physical description in entropy, constraint, and transport rather than geometry,
RSVP provides a substrate from which multiple theoretical formalisms can be recovered without
treating any of them as ontologically fundamental. The sections that follow demonstrate how
familiar physical theories arise when speciﬁc approximations suppress or coarse-grain aspects of
this underlying irreversibility, allowing geometry and law-like regularities to crystallize as eﬀective
descriptions.
3
Classical Mechanics as a Weak-History Limit
Classical mechanics occupies a peculiar position in the hierarchy of physical theories. It is historically
foundational and phenomenologically successful, yet conceptually fragile when examined from the
standpoint of irreversibility and thermodynamics. Newtonian dynamics are time-reversal invariant,
local in state, and governed by deterministic laws that treat the past and future symmetrically.
Within the RSVP framework, these features are not fundamental properties of nature but signatures
of a special regime in which entropy gradients are suﬃciently small and the cumulative eﬀects of
irreversible history can be neglected.
To make this precise, consider regions of the RSVP plenum in which entropy production is slow
relative to transport and constraint relaxation. Formally, this corresponds to regimes where ∂tS is
small and spatial variations in S are subdominant compared to variations in the scalar constraint
ﬁeld Φ. In such regions, the entropy evolution equation reduces to a consistency condition ensuring
near-balance between transport compression and dissipation,
α|∇Φ|2 + β|v|2 ≈δ∇· v.
(5)
This approximation suppresses explicit history dependence, allowing the system to be described
eﬀectively in terms of instantaneous ﬁeld values.
Under these conditions, transport aligns closely with constraint gradients, and torsional con-
tributions become negligible. Writing v = ∇χ for a scalar transport potential χ is then a good
approximation, reducing the vector evolution equation to
∂t∇χ + (∇χ · ∇)∇χ = −∇Φ.
(6)
Integrating once in space yields
∂tχ + 1
2|∇χ|2 + Φ = C(t),
(7)
where C(t) is a function of integration that may be absorbed into a redeﬁnition of χ. This equation is
formally identical to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a particle of unit mass moving in a potential
Φ, provided χ is identiﬁed with the classical action.
The emergence of Newtonian dynamics follows immediately. Identifying the transport velocity
with particle velocity, v = ˙x, and interpreting Φ as an eﬀective potential, one recovers
¨x = −∇Φ,
(8)
5

which is precisely Newton's second law. Importantly, this identiﬁcation is not an ontological postulate
but a regime-dependent correspondence. Particles do not exist as primitive objects in RSVP; they
arise as coherent transport features localized within slowly evolving constraint landscapes.
The apparent time-reversal invariance of classical mechanics is likewise emergent. In the weak-
history limit, entropy production is suﬃciently small that reversing transport trajectories does
not immediately violate thermodynamic ordering. The equations of motion become approximately
symmetric under t 7→−t, even though the underlying RSVP dynamics are not. This explains why
classical mechanics is so eﬀective in describing systems near equilibrium, yet fails dramatically in
contexts where dissipation, chaos, or measurement play a dominant role.
The action principle itself acquires a new interpretation in this framework. Rather than serving
as a fundamental variational law, the action functional
Scl =
Z 1
2|v|2 −Φ

dt
(9)
emerges as a compact summary of transport behavior in regimes where irreversible eﬀects can be
ignored. Extremization of this functional does not cause the motion; it encodes the regularities that
persist once entropy-driven corrections are suppressed. From the RSVP perspective, the action
is retrospective rather than generative, a bookkeeping device that becomes valid only after the
underlying thermodynamic constraints have stabilized.
This derivation clariﬁes both the power and the limitations of classical mechanics. Its laws
are not wrong, but contingent. They apply precisely in those regimes where the entropy ﬁeld S is
dynamically inert and the scalar constraint landscape evolves slowly. When these conditions fail, as
they inevitably do at small scales, high energies, or long times, classical descriptions break down
not because nature ceases to obey law, but because the law-like regularities they describe no longer
exist. Classical mechanics is thus revealed as the ﬁrst and simplest emergent interface between
irreversible entropy ﬂow and eﬀective geometric description.
4
Relativistic Structure Without Fundamental Spacetime
Relativistic physics is often taken to mark the point at which geometry becomes unavoidable. The
uniﬁcation of space and time into a four-dimensional manifold endowed with Lorentzian metric
structure appears, in standard presentations, as a decisive ontological shift. Within the RSVP
framework, however, relativistic phenomena do not require spacetime to be fundamental. Instead,
they arise when constraint propagation, transport ﬂow, and entropy production enter regimes where
ﬁnite propagation speed and causal ordering become dynamically enforced.
The key observation is that irreversible transport cannot proceed arbitrarily fast without
destabilizing constraint structure. Rapid redistribution of the scalar ﬁeld Φ generates steep entropy
gradients, increasing S at a rate that suppresses further acceleration. This introduces an eﬀective
upper bound on transport velocity, not as a postulated invariant speed, but as a stability condition.
Formally, consider perturbations of the scalar ﬁeld propagating along the transport direction.
Linearizing the RSVP equations about a stabilized background (Φ0, v0, S0) yields a wave-like
6

equation of the form
∂2
t δΦ −c2
eﬀ∇2δΦ + Γ∂tδΦ = 0,
(10)
where ceﬀis an eﬀective propagation speed determined by the background alignment of ∇Φ0 and
v0, and Γ encodes dissipative corrections due to entropy production. In regimes where Γ is small,
disturbances propagate along characteristic surfaces analogous to null cones, despite the absence of
any pre-deﬁned metric.
These characteristic surfaces deﬁne causal ordering relations. Events are ordered not by coor-
dinate time, but by accessibility through entropy-respecting transport paths. Two conﬁgurations
are causally related if information encoded in Φ and mediated by v can propagate between them
without violating entropy monotonicity. This replaces the geometric notion of light cones with a
dynamical notion of constraint cones, whose structure depends on local ﬁeld alignment rather than
global spacetime geometry.
Lorentz invariance emerges as a symmetry of these constraint cones in stabilized regimes. When
transport velocity saturates the entropy-limited bound uniformly across directions, the eﬀective
propagation speed ceﬀbecomes isotropic. Transformations between observers moving relative to
one another correspond to reparameterizations of transport ﬂow that preserve the causal ordering
induced by the constraint cones.
The familiar Lorentz transformations arise as the group of
transformations that leave invariant the form of the eﬀective wave operator governing δΦ, even
though no fundamental spacetime metric has been assumed.
Redshift phenomena admit a similarly non-geometric interpretation. In conventional cosmology,
redshift is attributed to metric expansion stretching wavelengths over time. Within RSVP, frequency
shifts arise from cumulative entropy accumulation along transport paths. As a signal propagates
through regions of varying constraint curvature, its phase evolution is modiﬁed by local changes in
Φ and v. Writing the phase θ of a propagating mode as satisfying
∂tθ + v · ∇θ = ω(Φ, S),
(11)
one ﬁnds that gradual entropy increase along the trajectory leads to systematic frequency drift.
Observed redshift thus encodes the integrated history of entropy descent rather than the expansion
of space itself.
This reinterpretation resolves several long-standing tensions. It preserves the empirical successes
of relativistic kinematics while eliminating the need to treat spacetime expansion as a fundamental
process.
It also integrates naturally with thermodynamic irreversibility, avoiding the uneasy
coexistence of time-symmetric geometric laws with entropy-driven arrows of time. Relativity appears
not as a statement about the structure of spacetime, but as a statement about the universality of
constraint propagation under entropy-limited transport.
Crucially, this perspective does not deny the utility of Lorentzian geometry. Once constraint cones
stabilize, it becomes eﬃcient to summarize their structure using an eﬀective metric. The Minkowski
metric, and its curved generalizations, function as compact encodings of causal accessibility relations
that are already present in the RSVP dynamics. Geometry is recovered as an emergent language
that faithfully represents these relations, but it is no longer required to carry ontological weight.
7

Relativistic physics thus marks not the triumph of geometry, but its successful emergence. By
deriving causal structure, invariant propagation speed, and redshift from irreversible entropy ﬂow,
RSVP demonstrates that spacetime is best understood as a secondary abstraction, valid precisely
because the deeper thermodynamic substrate enforces regularity. Physics after spacetime retains
relativity not by rejecting it, but by explaining why it works.
5
Gravity as Entropy Descent
Gravitational phenomena have long resisted uniﬁcation with the rest of fundamental physics. In
general relativity, gravity is not a force but a manifestation of spacetime curvature, while in quantum
theory it remains conspicuously absent from the standard framework. Thermodynamic approaches
to gravity have sought to bridge this divide by reinterpreting gravitational dynamics as emergent
consequences of entropy, information, or horizon thermodynamics (Jacobson 1995; Verlinde 2011;
Carney et al. 2019). While these approaches oﬀer important insights, they typically retain geometric
structure as a foundational element, treating entropy as a property of spacetime rather than as the
generator of spacetime-like behavior itself.
Within the RSVP framework, gravity appears more directly as a manifestation of entropy descent
acting on constraint curvature. The scalar ﬁeld Φ encodes the topology of constraint, and its spatial
curvature determines how transport is redirected within the plenum. Regions of high constraint
curvature act as sinks for entropy-driven ﬂow, not because they exert force in the Newtonian sense,
but because entropy production is minimized when transport aligns toward conﬁgurations of lower
constraint tension. Gravitational attraction thus reﬂects the tendency of irreversible dynamics to
reorganize structure toward smoother constraint distributions.
This can be made explicit by examining stationary solutions of the RSVP equations in regimes
where transport has equilibrated but entropy production remains nonzero. Setting ∂tv ≈0 and
neglecting higher-order torsional corrections, the transport equation reduces to
(v · ∇)v = −∇Φ.
(12)
In stabilized regimes where v is small or slowly varying, this equation implies that transport
accelerates toward regions of decreasing Φ, reproducing the qualitative behavior of gravitational
attraction. However, unlike in Newtonian gravity, the source of this acceleration is not an externally
imposed potential, but the internal redistribution of constraint driven by entropy growth.
The role of entropy becomes clearer when one considers the coupled evolution of Φ and S. The
scalar ﬁeld equation includes an explicit sink term proportional to S, reﬂecting the consumption
of constraint capacity by irreversible processes. In regions where entropy accumulates rapidly, the
scalar ﬁeld relaxes more quickly, ﬂattening constraint gradients and redirecting transport from
neighboring regions. This feedback produces an eﬀective attraction toward entropy-producing
regions, which from an external perspective appears as gravitational mass.
Mass itself is therefore not a primitive property but an emergent measure of constraint curvature
8

sustained by entropy ﬂow. A simple diagnostic for mass density ρeﬀwithin RSVP may be deﬁned by
ρeﬀ∝|∇2Φ| + λ(∇Φ · v),
(13)
where the ﬁrst term captures local constraint curvature and the second encodes coupling between
constraint gradients and transport. Stable mass concentrations correspond to spectral bifurcations
of the scalar ﬁeld, satisfying
∇2Φ + κS = 0,
(14)
which admits discrete modes whose persistence depends on sustained entropy throughput. These
modes play the role of matter sources in eﬀective gravitational descriptions.
The emergence of curvature-based formulations follows naturally. When constraint curvature
becomes spatially coherent over large regions, it is eﬃcient to encode transport redirection using an
eﬀective metric whose connection coeﬃcients summarize the inﬂuence of ∇Φ on nearby trajectories.
The Einstein ﬁeld equations then arise as a macroscopic closure condition relating eﬀective curvature
to entropy-supported constraint structure, rather than as fundamental dynamical laws. In this sense,
the geometric description of gravity is a thermodynamic coarse-graining of RSVP dynamics, valid
when entropy descent organizes constraint curvature smoothly enough to admit a metric summary.
This perspective clariﬁes the partial successes and limitations of existing thermodynamic gravity
proposals. Jacobsons derivation of Einsteins equations from local horizon thermodynamics captures
the necessity of entropy balance but presupposes spacetime structure. Verlindes entropic gravity
identiﬁes gravitational force with entropy gradients but treats information holographically rather than
dynamically. RSVP subsumes these insights while avoiding their residual geometric commitments,
grounding gravity directly in irreversible ﬁeld evolution rather than in horizon-based arguments.
Importantly, gravity in RSVP is inseparable from irreversibility. There is no meaningful notion of
a time-reversed gravitational process in which constraint curvature spontaneously sharpens without
compensating entropy production. This resolves the long-standing tension between the apparent
time symmetry of gravitational laws and the thermodynamic arrow of time. Gravity points in the
same temporal direction as entropy because it is generated by the same underlying process.
By interpreting gravity as entropy descent acting on constraint topology, RSVP eliminates the
need to treat curvature as fundamental while preserving the empirical content of gravitational
physics. Curved spacetime is not denied, but reinterpreted as a stabilized interface description that
becomes valid once entropy-driven dynamics have organized constraint structure at macroscopic
scales. Gravity, like geometry itself, is thus revealed as a consequence rather than a cause.

Gauge Structure and Action Principles as Entropic Bookkeep-
ing
Gauge symmetry occupies a central place in contemporary physics. From electromagnetism to
the Standard Model, physical interactions are formulated in terms of ﬁelds deﬁned up to local
redundancy, with dynamics constrained by symmetry principles and variational extremization.
Within geometric approaches, gauge structure is often treated as fundamental, reﬂecting deep
9

properties of the underlying conﬁguration space. In the RSVP framework, by contrast, gauge
symmetry is neither mysterious nor primitive. It emerges as a representational freedom inherent in
describing stabilized constraint regimes while suppressing the irreversible microhistory that produced
them.
The origin of gauge redundancy in RSVP can be traced to the multiplicity of ﬁeld conﬁgurations
that realize the same macroscopic constraint organization. Once entropy descent has driven the
system into a stable regime, many distinct microtrajectories in (Φ, v, S) space converge toward the
same eﬀective transport and curvature patterns. Any description that neglects the detailed history of
entropy production must therefore identify these microstates as equivalent. Gauge transformations
express precisely this identiﬁcation: they relate distinct ﬁeld conﬁgurations that diﬀer in bookkeeping
details but encode the same constraint accessibility relations.
This perspective clariﬁes why gauge symmetry becomes more exact at lower energies and larger
scales. As entropy-driven ﬂuctuations are averaged out, the space of indistinguishable microhistories
expands, enlarging the equivalence classes represented by gauge orbits. Conversely, at high energies
or small scales, where entropy production is rapid and constraint structure is continually reorganized,
gauge descriptions become fragile or break down altogether. Gauge symmetry is thus a diagnostic
of stabilization, not a fundamental organizing principle imposed from above.
Action principles admit a similar reinterpretation.
In conventional formulations, physical
trajectories are obtained by extremizing an action functional, often taken to encode the deepest
laws of nature. From the RSVP standpoint, this variational structure arises only after irreversible
dynamics have been suppressed suﬃciently to allow trajectories to be summarized compactly.
Consider again the classical action
Seﬀ=
Z
L(Φ, v) dt,
(15)
where L is an eﬀective Lagrangian constructed from stabilized ﬁelds.
Extremal paths of Seﬀ
correspond not to physically enforced optimization, but to the most economical summaries of
transport behavior once entropy production has been neglected. The extremization principle reﬂects
the elimination of redundant history, not the mechanism of motion itself.
This explains why action-based formulations struggle to incorporate irreversibility directly.
Variational calculus presupposes reversible exploration of neighboring trajectories, yet RSVP
dynamics privilege a single direction of evolution enforced by entropy growth. Attempts to encode
dissipation within action principles typically require auxiliary structures, doubled degrees of freedom,
or nonlocal terms, all of which signal a mismatch between the ontology and the formalism. In RSVP,
dissipation is not an add-on; it is the ground from which reversible approximations emerge.
Gauge ﬁelds themselves can be understood as collective descriptors of constraint transport. The
familiar gauge potentials summarize how transport responds to variations in Φ while respecting
equivalence under entropy-erased microhistory. Field strengths then measure the obstruction to
globally ﬂattening constraint structure, corresponding to residual curvature that cannot be removed
by local reparameterization. In this sense, gauge curvature reﬂects persistent constraint tension
rather than fundamental interaction strength.
The appearance of conserved quantities follows naturally. Noethers theorem associates symmetries
of the action with conserved currents, yet within RSVP conservation laws arise only when entropy
10

production is suﬃciently suppressed to allow persistent invariants. Energy, momentum, and charge
conservation are therefore regime-dependent regularities, not absolute principles. They hold precisely
when constraint relaxation and entropy growth balance in a manner that stabilizes transport patterns
over time.
By situating gauge symmetry and action principles downstream of irreversible entropy ﬂow,
RSVP dissolves several longstanding conceptual puzzles. Gauge redundancy no longer demands
metaphysical interpretation, and action extremization ceases to function as a causal law. Both
are recognized as eﬃcient representational tools that become valid only after the underlying
thermodynamic substrate has organized itself into stable regimes. This reframing prepares the
ground for understanding quantum descriptions as further coarse-grainings of irreversible dynamics,
a task to which we now turn.
7
Time as Emergent Translation
In standard physical theories, time is introduced at the outset as a coordinate or parameter indexing
change. Whether treated as absolute, relativistic, or operator-valued, it functions as a pre-existing
axis along which dynamics unfold. Even when time is declared relative or dynamical, it remains
geometrized, embedded within the same representational category as space. The RSVP framework
rejects this starting point. Time is not assumed as a dimension, coordinate, or background parameter.
Instead, it emerges as a derived notion indexing irreversible translation through ﬁeld conﬁguration
space.
The need for a temporal ordering arises only once entropy becomes nonzero. In the absence of
entropy production, conﬁgurations may be permuted without physical distinction, and no meaningful
arrow can be deﬁned. Irreversibility introduces asymmetry by enforcing a partial ordering on states:
some conﬁgurations are reachable from others, but not vice versa. Time, in RSVP, is the structure
induced by this ordering, not an independent entity imposed upon it.
Formally, RSVP dynamics are written using a parameter t for notational convenience, but this
parameter has no ontological signiﬁcance. Physical time corresponds instead to a composite operator
acting on the evolving ﬁelds (Φ, v, S). A minimal deﬁnition may be given by the translation operator
T[Φ, v, S] := (∂tΦ, ∇· v, ∂tS) ,
(16)
which captures the local rate of constraint relaxation, transport divergence, and entropy production.
This operator does not deﬁne duration or simultaneity directly; rather, it encodes the direction and
intensity of irreversible evolution. Time exists only where T is nonvanishing and aligned coherently
across ﬁelds.
A physically meaningful temporal ﬂow emerges when constraint gradients, transport, and entropy
production become aligned. In stabilized regimes satisfying
⟨∇Φ, v⟩> 0
and
∂tS > 0,
(17)
the system admits a consistent ordering of conﬁgurations along transport trajectories. One may
11

then deﬁne an eﬀective timeﬂow vector
T µ = ∇µΦ + ηvµ + θ∇µS,
(18)
where η and θ encode relative coupling strengths. This vector is timelike not by geometric ﬁat,
but because it points along directions of increasing entropy and decreasing constraint tension.
Causality is enforced thermodynamically: transitions that would reverse entropy ﬂow are dynamically
inaccessible.
This construction clariﬁes the origin of temporal asymmetry. The arrow of time is not imposed
by boundary conditions or cosmological initial states, but generated continuously by entropy descent.
Every irreversible interaction contributes locally to temporal ordering, and global time emerges as a
coherent alignment of these local translations. Where entropy production is minimal or ﬂuctuating,
temporal structure becomes weak or ambiguous, explaining why time appears ill-deﬁned in certain
quantum or gravitational regimes.
The familiar properties of time follow as eﬀective regularities. Duration corresponds to ac-
cumulated entropy-weighted translation along transport paths. Simultaneity reﬂects equivalence
classes of conﬁgurations that are mutually accessible without intervening entropy production. Time
dilation arises when constraint curvature or transport divergence alters the local rate of entropy
generation, modifying the eﬀective translation rate relative to distant regions. These eﬀects need
not be attributed to spacetime geometry; they arise directly from RSVP ﬁeld dynamics.
This perspective resolves several longstanding conceptual diﬃculties. It eliminates the category
error of treating time as a spatial dimension, avoids the need for multiple temporal axes, and
integrates temporal asymmetry seamlessly with thermodynamics. It also explains why time behaves
diﬀerently across physical regimes. In classical mechanics, where entropy production is negligible,
time appears as an external parameter. In relativistic settings, where transport saturation enforces
universal ordering, time acquires invariant structure. In quantum contexts, where microhistory is
inaccessible, time becomes probabilistic and relational.
Time, then, is not the stage upon which physics unfolds, but the trace left by irreversible
evolution. It is a secondary construct that becomes meaningful only after constraint, transport,
and entropy have organized themselves into coherent patterns. Physics after spacetime is therefore
also physics after fundamental time. What remains is not timelessness, but a deeper temporality
grounded in irreversible translation rather than geometric extension.
8
Quantum Descriptions as Coarse-Grained Irreversibility
Quantum theory presents a distinctive challenge for any foundational reconstruction. Its formalism
is extraordinarily successful, yet its conceptual structure resists straightforward interpretation.
Probabilistic outcomes, superposition, and nonlocal correlations appear to conﬂict with classical
intuitions about causality and time. Within the RSVP framework, these features are not taken as
fundamental mysteries, but as signatures of a regime in which irreversible microhistory is inaccessible
and temporal ordering becomes intrinsically coarse-grained.
The deﬁning move of quantum theory is the replacement of deterministic trajectories with
12

probability amplitudes. In RSVP terms, this replacement occurs when the detailed evolution of
(Φ, v, S) cannot be resolved at the scales relevant to observation. When entropy production is rapid
and constraint structure reorganizes faster than transport can be tracked, distinct microhistories
converge toward indistinguishable macroscopic conﬁgurations. The observer is then forced to
describe evolution not by following a single entropy-respecting path, but by assigning weights to
equivalence classes of histories compatible with observed constraints.
Formally, let Γ denote the space of admissible RSVP histories connecting two stabilized conﬁgura-
tions. Each history γ ∈Γ corresponds to a distinct irreversible trajectory through ﬁeld conﬁguration
space, characterized by cumulative entropy production

When the resolution of observation is insuﬃcient to distinguish between individual γ, physical
description collapses onto a distribution over Γ. The appropriate weighting is not arbitrary; histories
that violate entropy monotonicity are dynamically excluded, while those with comparable entropy
production contribute collectively. Probabilities thus arise as normalized measures over irreversibly
admissible histories rather than as fundamental stochastic laws.
The appearance of superposition reﬂects this aggregation. A quantum state does not represent
a system occupying multiple conﬁgurations simultaneously, but a bookkeeping device encoding
uncertainty over which irreversible history has occurred. Linear structure emerges because, once
microhistory is erased, the composition of alternatives must preserve consistency under coarse-
graining. Hilbert space formalism provides precisely such a linearized representation of equivalence
classes of histories, even though the underlying RSVP dynamics are nonlinear and dissipative.
Temporal structure in this regime is necessarily relational. Because time itself is derived from
entropy-weighted translation, the loss of microhistory entails a loss of sharp temporal ordering.
Operators that do not commute correspond to observables whose measurement sequences probe
incompatible coarse-grainings of irreversible evolution. The uncertainty relations thus reﬂect limits on
simultaneously reconstructing multiple aspects of past entropy production, rather than fundamental
indeterminacy in nature.
Quantum dynamics, typically expressed through unitary evolution, acquire a retrospective
interpretation. Unitarity ensures conservation of total probability across equivalence classes of
histories, not reversibility of physical processes. The apparent time symmetry of the Schrdinger
equation arises because entropy production has already been averaged out in constructing the
quantum description. Irreversibility persists beneath the formalism, but no longer appears explicitly
once history has been erased.
Measurement occupies a privileged role precisely because it reintroduces irreversibility.
A
measurement event corresponds to a localized surge in entropy production that collapses equivalence
classes of histories into a narrower subset compatible with the recorded outcome. From the RSVP
perspective, collapse is not a dynamical anomaly, but the moment at which irreversible constraint is
reasserted. The classical world emerges not by suppressing quantum behavior, but by continually
generating entropy through interaction, record formation, and environmental coupling.
13

This interpretation reframes long-standing debates about realism and locality. Nonlocal correla-
tions arise because coarse-grained descriptions encode global constraints on admissible histories, not
because information propagates instantaneously. Entanglement reﬂects shared constraint ancestry
rather than superluminal inﬂuence. What appears paradoxical when viewed through the lens of
spacetime geometry becomes natural when geometry itself is recognized as emergent.
Quantum theory, then, is not the fundamental layer beneath classical physics, but an intermediate
interface description that becomes necessary when irreversible microhistory cannot be resolved. It
occupies the regime between fully stabilized classical constraint dynamics and the deeper entropic
substrate from which both classical and relativistic structures arise. In this sense, quantum mechanics
is neither mysterious nor complete; it is a powerful approximation whose domain of validity is
precisely delineated by the loss of temporal resolution induced by entropy.

Interface Theories and Higher-Order Corrections
As physical descriptions are extended toward higher energies or ﬁner resolutions, the simplicity of
emergent geometric and ﬁeld-theoretic formulations begins to fail. Singularities appear, perturbative
expansions diverge, and eﬀective descriptions lose predictive power. The standard response has
been to seek ultraviolet completions by introducing new degrees of freedom or quantizing existing
geometric structures. Within the RSVP framework, these pathologies are interpreted diﬀerently.
They signal not the need for deeper geometry, but the breakdown of an interface description whose
validity depends on stabilized constraint regimes.
Eﬀective ﬁeld theories provide a canonical example. They extend low-energy descriptions by
adding higher-order operators suppressed by a cutoﬀscale, encoding the inﬂuence of unresolved
microstructure. From the RSVP perspective, such operators summarize the cumulative eﬀects
of entropy-driven smoothing and constraint redistribution that cannot be captured by leading-
order terms alone. They do not reveal new fundamental interactions; they correct for the loss of
information induced by coarse-graining.
Quadratic gravity occupies a particularly instructive position in this landscape. The inclusion of
curvature-squared terms in the gravitational action has long been known to improve renormalization
behavior while introducing conceptual diﬃculties such as ghost modes. In RSVP, these features
acquire a natural interpretation. Curvature-squared terms arise when the eﬀective metric description
is pushed beyond the regime where constraint curvature varies slowly. They encode the response of
transport and entropy production to sharp variations in Φ that are invisible at lower resolution.
This can be seen by examining the entropic smoothing of constraint curvature. The scalar ﬁeld
Φ undergoes diﬀusion driven by entropy production, which may be represented schematically as
Φ(x) 7→
Z
Kσ(x −y) Φ(y) dy,
(20)
where Kσ is a smoothing kernel with width σ set by entropy throughput. Expanding this transfor-
mation in powers of σ generates higher-order derivative corrections, including terms proportional to
∇4Φ. When translated into the eﬀective metric language, these corrections correspond to quadratic
14

curvature invariants. Their appearance is therefore a mathematical artifact of smoothing irreversible
dynamics into a geometric interface, not evidence of new fundamental degrees of freedom.
The instability associated with ghost modes reﬂects the tension between irreversible dynamics
and reversible geometric representation. Interface theories inherit time-reversal symmetry from their
variational formulation, even when the underlying RSVP dynamics are irreversible. Pushing such
theories beyond their regime of validity exposes this mismatch, manifesting as unphysical modes or
instabilities. Rather than signaling inconsistency in RSVP, these pathologies mark the limits of
geometry-based summaries.
A similar interpretation applies to other proposed ultraviolet modiﬁcations of gravity and ﬁeld
theory. Higher-spin extensions, nonlocal actions, and modiﬁed dispersion relations can all be viewed
as attempts to patch geometric descriptions where entropy-driven constraint reorganization becomes
too rapid or too ﬁne-grained to ignore. Each introduces additional structure to stabilize the interface,
but none addresses the underlying source of breakdown, which lies in the suppression of irreversible
history.
From this vantage point, the search for a fundamental ultraviolet theory of gravity is misplaced.
There is no deeper geometric layer waiting to be quantized. What exists beneath eﬀective descriptions
is not another metric or symmetry group, but the entropic substrate itself. Interface theories are
necessary and useful, but they should be recognized as such. Their role is to mediate between
stabilized emergent regimes and the irreducible irreversibility of the RSVP dynamics.
Recognizing interface theories as regime-dependent clariﬁes why so many approaches to quantum
gravity have yielded partial success without convergence. Each captures aspects of constraint
smoothing or entropy-limited transport, yet each remains incomplete because it treats geometry as
fundamental rather than emergent. RSVP does not compete with these theories at the same level;
it explains why they arise and why they fail.
With this understanding in place, we are in a position to assess what remains once geometry,
action, gauge symmetry, and even time have been demoted from fundamental status. The ﬁnal
section draws these threads together and articulates what it means to do physics after spacetime.

Discussion and Conclusion: What Remains After Spacetime
The derivations presented in this essay motivate a reorganization of physical foundations. Rather
than treating spacetime, geometry, and symmetry as primitive structures upon which dynamics are
imposed, we have shown that these elements arise as eﬀective descriptions of a deeper thermodynamic
substrate governed by irreversible entropy ﬂow and constraint relaxation. Classical mechanics,
relativistic kinematics, gravitational curvature, gauge redundancy, and quantum probability each
emerge as regime-dependent interfaces that become valid only when aspects of irreversible history
are suppressed or coarse-grained.
This shift does not diminish the empirical achievements of established theories. On the contrary,
it explains their extraordinary robustness. Laws appear stable precisely because entropy descent
organizes constraint structure into repeatable patterns over wide ranges of scale. Geometry works
because irreversible dynamics enforce causal accessibility relations that can be summarized metrically.
15

Action principles succeed because stabilized transport permits history to be compressed into
variational form. Quantum mechanics proves indispensable because lost microhistory necessitates
probabilistic bookkeeping.
None of these successes require their associated formalisms to be
ontologically fundamental.
What is demoted by this perspective is the assumption that explanation must proceed geometri-
cally. Spacetime ceases to function as the arena of physics and becomes instead a representational
artifact that crystallizes once constraint propagation and entropy production achieve suﬃcient
regularity. Time itself is no longer a dimension or coordinate but the trace of irreversible translation
through ﬁeld conﬁguration space. Causality is enforced not by metric structure but by thermody-
namic accessibility. Probability is not intrinsic indeterminism but the measure induced by erased
history.
What replaces geometry as foundation is not abstraction but constraint. The RSVP framework
places irreversibility at the center of physical description, insisting that any ontology capable of
supporting records, observers, and stable structure must encode entropy growth at the most basic
level. This move resolves a number of persistent tensions. It aligns gravity with the arrow of
time rather than opposing it. It explains why quantization appears necessary without positing
fundamentally stochastic dynamics. It clariﬁes why ultraviolet completions proliferate without
convergence, revealing them as attempts to stabilize emergent interfaces rather than to access deeper
geometric truth.
The resulting picture suggests a new criterion for fundamentality. A structure is fundamental not
if it is mathematically elegant or unifying, but if it survives arbitrary reﬁnement without generating
contradictions. Geometry fails this test, as it must be continually supplemented when pushed
beyond stabilized regimes. Entropy and constraint do not. Irreversibility cannot be coarse-grained
away without eliminating the very possibility of physical law.
Several open directions follow naturally. Empirically, RSVP predicts deviations from geometric
cosmology in regimes where entropy accumulation and constraint relaxation dominate, oﬀering
potential tests via redshift hysteresis, ﬂow memory, and nonmetric lensing eﬀects. Theoretically, the
derived nature of gauge and action principles motivates a reformulation of quantization directly at
the level of irreversible dynamics, rather than through geometric canonicalization. Conceptually,
the emergence of time as translation rather than dimension invites reconsideration of causality,
measurement, and agency across physics and cognition alike.
Physics after spacetime is not physics without structure, but physics grounded in the only
structure that cannot be idealized away.
Once irreversible entropy ﬂow is taken seriously as
primitive, the rest of physical law follows not as assumption, but as consequence. Geometry, time,
and probability survive precisely because they are useful summaries of constraint-organized dynamics.
They are retained, but no longer worshipped.
In this sense, the end of spacetime as a foundation does not mark a loss, but a clariﬁcation.
What remains is a physics whose basic commitments align with the thermodynamic reality of the
world it seeks to describe.

B
Hamilton-Jacobi Structure as a Weak-Entropy Limit
Assume a regime in which entropy production is negligible and slowly varying,
∂tS ≈0,
∇S ≈0,
(31)
and torsional eﬀects vanish,
∇× v = 0.
(32)
There exists a scalar function χ such that
v = ∇χ.
(33)
Substituting (33) into the transport equation
∂tv + (v · ∇)v = −∇Φ,
(34)
yields
∂t∇χ + (∇χ · ∇)∇χ = −∇Φ.
(35)
Integrating spatially gives

The Hamilton-Jacobi formulation arises as a reduction of RSVP transport under suppression of
entropy gradients and torsional transport.

Time as an Entropy-Weighted Translation Operator
Let (Φ, v, S) evolve under (21)-(23). Deﬁne the local translation operator
T[Φ, v, S] := (∂tΦ, ∇· v, ∂tS) .

Coherent temporal orientation is enforced by
∂tS > 0,

(51)
Deﬁne the eﬀective timeﬂow vector ﬁeld
T µ = ∇µΦ + η vµ + θ ∇µS,

Deﬁne an entropy-weighted increment along an admissible trajectory γ in conﬁguration space by
dτeﬀ:= ω(Φ, v, S) dS,
ω(Φ, v, S) > 0.
(53)
Equivalently, along γ,
dτeﬀ= ω(Φ, v, S) ∂tS dt.

Entropic Smoothing and Quadratic Curvature Interfaces

Kσ(z) = (4πσ)−2 exp

For suﬃciently regular Φ, expand Φσ in σ:
Φσ = exp
 σ∇2
Φ = Φ + σ∇2Φ + σ2
2 ∇4Φ + O(σ3).
(60)
Deﬁne an eﬀective geometric encoding by identifying an emergent metric gµν whose curvature
20

summarizes constraint curvature,
R ∼∇2Φ,
∇4Φ ∼∇2R.
(61)
Substituting (60) into any eﬀective scalar functional F[Φσ] quadratic in gradients yields higher-
derivative terms. In particular, for
F[Φσ] =

with coeﬃcients ci = ci(a, b, σ).
The quadratic invariants arise universally from the σ2 term in (60). Their relative weights
depend on the tensorial decomposition of ∇4Φ under the emergent metric identiﬁcation.
Ghost-like modes correspond to extending the interface description beyond the regime in which
(60) truncation is valid. In Fourier space, smoothing suppresses high-momentum modes,
eΦσ(k) = e−σk2 eΦ(k),
(64)
while curvature-squared truncations reintroduce unsuppressed high-k behavior when extrapolated
outside the smoothing window.
Eﬀective equations of motion derived from (63) are stable only for wavelengths satisfying
k2 ≪σ−1.
(65)
Quadratic gravity thus arises as a second-order interface expansion of entropic smoothing, not
as a fundamental ultraviolet completion.
