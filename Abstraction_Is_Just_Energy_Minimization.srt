1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today we are doing something a little, uh, a little different.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,240
A lot different, I'd say.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,940
Yeah, that's fair. Usually we take a topic, say, you know, the history of the shipping container

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,640
or the nuances of microbiome science, and we really drill down into the specifics.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,120
Right, we find one thread and pull on it.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,240
Exactly. But today we're going to try to drill down into, well, everything. All of it.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,240
The machinery of reality itself.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,340
It's ambitious, to say the least.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,760
That is putting it mildly.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,100
The source material for this Deep Dive is a dense, sprawling monograph titled,

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,740
Abstraction is Reduction. A Unified Account of Evaluation, Structure, and Proof.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,240
And I have to admit, when I first saw that title, my eyes kind of glazed over.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,000
I thought, okay, great. Another dry, academic slog through obscure computer science theory.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,240
I was, uh, I was ready to cancel the recording session.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,160
I don't blame you. Abstraction as Reduction sounds like the kind of thing you'd read if

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,120
you're having trouble sleeping. It just sounds incredibly dry.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,820
It does. But then I started reading the notes you sent over, and I realized my initial reaction

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,780
was, well, it was exactly the problem the book is trying to solve.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,700
Oh, how so?

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,060
I was looking at the surface and just completely ignoring the engine underneath.

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,940
This isn't just about code, is it?

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,860
No, not at all. It uses code as a language, sure. It has to use some language.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,940
But the argument here is that the principles governing how a computer program runs

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,960
are the exact same principles governing how your brain processes trauma,

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,360
how a magnet organizes its fields, and even how we make ethical decisions.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:44,860
Oh.

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,760
It's a grand unified theory of structure.

28
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,080
That's the hook that got me. The idea that there is a single mathematical move,

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,040
one specific action that explains all these different layers of reality. So let's start

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,400
with that title concept, abstraction.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,020
Okay.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,620
When I use that word in, you know, just casual conversation, I usually mean vague,

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,340
or I mean a shortcut. Like, I drive a car, he's a steering wheel on the pedals. That's

34
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,160
the abstraction. I don't need to know how the fuel injection timing works or the thermodynamics

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,880
of the combustion chamber. The abstraction hides the messy details so I can just get to

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,620
the grocery store.

37
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,100
That is the conventional view. That is what you'll find in almost every computer science

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,220
textbook or, you know, philosophy intro. We tend to think of abstraction as a shield.

39
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,220
A shield, yeah.

40
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,380
It's a protective layer that hides complexity. You treat the car as a single object car, so

41
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,160
you don't have to treat it as 10,000 moving parts.

42
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,160
It's a mental coping mechanism.

43
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,940
But the author of this monograph, a researcher who goes by fliction, he argues that this view

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,140
is fundamentally backward, or at least it's missing the mechanism.

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,940
Backward.

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,400
He argues that abstraction isn't just hiding details. It is a reductional act.

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,620
A reductional act.

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,880
It is a physical, almost destructive process where degrees of freedom are eliminated.

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,660
Destructive is a strong word. You're saying that when I abstract the car, I am destroying

50
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,260
something.

51
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,400
In a sense, yes. Think about it energetically. You said you don't need to know about the engine

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
to drive. Why?

53
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,820
Because it just works.

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,340
Because the engine has been engineered. It has been constrained.

55
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,200
The pistons can only move in a specific way. The fuel can only ignite at a specific time.

56
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,680
The abstraction of the steering wheel is only possible because the utter chaos of a controlled

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,380
explosion has been ruthlessly reduced into linear motion.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,580
You can't abstract a pile of burning gasoline. You can only abstract an engine.

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,840
I see. So abstraction isn't about me ignoring the details. It's about the system itself having

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,820
crushed those details into a stable shape that allows me to ignore them.

61
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,460
Precisely. And that brings us to the core thesis. You cannot abstract something that is still

62
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:11,180
thinking or still resolving its internal conflicts. Abstraction is what happens after the conflict

63
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,880
is resolved.

64
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,940
So that's the mission of this deep dive then.

65
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,380
Exactly. To trace the single principle that to abstract is to reduce from the simplest math

66
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,820
all the way up to high dimensional physics and even ethics.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,820
And there's an equation for this, right? I know, you know, audio format, math is hard.

68
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,720
But this one seems simple enough that even I could wrap my head around it.

69
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,980
It is the backbone of the entire work. And it's more of an equivalence, really. The equation is

70
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,940
abstraction equals reduction equals computation equals energy minimization.

71
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,420
Okay. Abstraction, reduction, computation, and then energy minimization. That's where it gets weird

72
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:50,740
for me.

73
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,220
Yeah. That's where it leaves the computer lab.

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,900
Right. I get that computation is reduction. I think we'll get into that. But are we really saying

75
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,760
that solving a math problem is the same thing as a ball rolling down a hill?

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,240
We are. The source argues they are structurally identical. Whether it is a student solving for

77
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,500
X, a neuron firing to recognize a face, or a physical system settling into a crystal lattice,

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,260
the process is the same.

79
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:17,880
Which is what?

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:25,160
High complexity, high energy, and high uncertainty collapse into a stable, simpler, low energy form.

81
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,920
That collapse, that is abstraction.

82
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,080
Okay. That is a massive claim. To prove it, we have to start at the very bottom.

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,580
The beginning.

84
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,620
The source takes us back to the 1930s, before modern computers even existed, to something

85
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,400
called the lambda calculus. Now, I know the name sounds like a fraternity, but this is Alonzo

86
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,700
Church's work. Why do we start here? Why not with, say, Turing machines?

87
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,460
It's a great question. Because Turing machines, which are the model for standard computers,

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,620
are mechanical. They have tape. They have heads that read and write. They have states.

89
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,700
They feel like machines?

90
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,380
They do. They feel like little factories. Lambda calculus is different. The source calls it the

91
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,340
embryo of computation. It has no hard drive. It has no loops. It has no data types. It doesn't even

92
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,340
have numbers, strictly speaking.

93
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,720
So what does it have? What's left?

94
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,520
It just has functions. And it has variables. And it has the ability to apply a function to

95
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,580
a variable. That's it. It's pure substitution.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,060
It sounds almost too simple to be useful.

97
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,200
And yet, it can compute anything that can be computed.

98
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,680
Yeah.

99
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,040
But the reason the source focuses on it is because of how it handles work. Work. In lambda

100
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,500
calculus, there is a concept called the redex. That's R-E-D-E-X. It stands for a reducible

101
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,240
expression.

102
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,900
A redex.

103
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,260
Imagine a box that contains a rule, a function. And sitting right next to it is a value. That

104
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,140
pairing the rule and the input waiting to be processed is a redex.

105
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,500
So it's potential energy?

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,900
Exactly. It represents work that needs to be done.

107
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,380
So it's like a loaded spring.

108
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,140
Hmm.

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,960
Or a mousetrap that's been set.

110
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,220
A loaded spring is the perfect analogy. And the act of computation in this system is called

111
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,880
better reduction. Beta reduction.

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Beta reduction.

113
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,640
It's the act of triggering the spring. You take the value, you shove it into the function,

114
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,700
you execute the rule, and the box, the function, and the value disappears. You are left with just

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,320
the result.

116
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,560
So you're destroying the instruction and replacing it with the answer.

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,800
Yes. And you keep doing this. If the answer you get contains another redex, another loaded

118
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,880
spring, you trigger that one too.

119
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,300
Right.

120
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,600
You keep collapsing these boxes one by one until there are no more redexes left.

121
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,500
And what happens when you run out of redexes?

122
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:48,720
Yeah.

123
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,500
When all the springs have sprung?

124
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:58,300
You reach what is called normal form. This is a critical concept. A term is in normal form when

125
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,100
it can no longer be reduced. It is, for all intents and purposes, dead. It is static.

126
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,740
That sounds kind of grim. Dead.

127
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,420
It's grim if you're a romantic, but it's wonderful if you're a mathematician. Normal form is just

128
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,780
another name for the answer.

129
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,800
Okay.

130
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,760
When you ask, what is two plus two? Two plus two is the redex. It's the tension. It's the loaded

131
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,660
spring. Four is the normal form.

132
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,120
I see.

133
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,380
Four isn't a computation. Four is a value. The source says it is the corpse of a computation

134
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,280
that has finished.

135
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,700
So to abstract something is to kill it.

136
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,520
To abstract something is to resolve it, to finish the work. The source argues that you can only treat

137
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,180
four as a stable, reliable object because you aren't constantly recalculating it. If four was

138
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,800
unstable, if it sometimes equaled five, you couldn't build anything on top of it. You couldn't do

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,240
accounting.

140
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,820
This connects directly to the next section, which uses an analogy everyone will hype, but everyone

141
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,920
understands. Algebra homework.

142
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,980
Algebra as interface literacy. It's brilliant because it takes this high theory of computer

143
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,920
science and puts it right in a classroom.

144
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:12,540
Right. So say I had the equation $3 plus five equals 21er. When I was in school, I just thought

145
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,140
of this as a puzzle. I need to move the numbers around until I get X alone.

146
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,380
And that moving numbers around is literally manual beta reduction. You are the computer.

147
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:22,960
Oh, wow.

148
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,480
You write $3 equals 15 one eyes. That's one reduction step. You write sex X equals five five. That's the

149
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,180
final reduction. You have reached normal form.

150
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,620
But the source makes a point here about showing your work. My teachers were obsessed with that. I

151
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,780
always thought they were just being sadistic, you know.

152
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,520
They were asking you to expose the intermediate reduction steps. They wanted to see the read X's

153
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,940
before they collapsed. But there is a deeper philosophical point here that the source makes.

154
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,360
The equation $3 plus five isn't just a puzzle.

155
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,360
What is it then?

156
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,200
It is a functional contract.

157
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,900
A contract.

158
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,420
Yes. Think about it. That equation defines a relationship. It defines a constraint on reality.

159
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:12,400
It says, I will only accept a value for X that when you triple it and add five to it yields exactly

160
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,980
20. It's like a lock.

161
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,220
It's a strict gateway. A very specific lock.

162
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,680
Yeah.

163
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,980
Solving the equation is the process of finding the one thing in the universe that can satisfy

164
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,420
that contract. The one key that fits.

165
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,440
So the answer five is the only thing that fits the shape of the hole created by the question.

166
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,720
Exactly. And once you have the answer five, you can throw away the equation. You don't need the

167
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,920
complexity of $3 plus five equals $20 anymore. You can just use five.

168
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,080
That is the abstraction.

169
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,420
That's it. You have replaced a complex relationship with a simple identity. You have reduced the

170
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,280
degrees of freedom from any number in existence down to this specific number.

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,640
This feels like it bridges really nicely into the world of software engineering because if

172
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,780
algebra is doing this manually, coding is just automating it.

173
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,100
Right.

174
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,220
The source spends a lot of time on the programming language Haskell and this idea of type classes.

175
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,440
Now, I know our audience isn't all software engineers, so let's keep this conceptual.

176
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,660
What does a type class tell us about the nature of reality?

177
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:23,440
Well, it tells us about how we define things. In the old way of thinking, maybe the platonic

178
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,300
way we define things by what they are. Their essence.

179
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,280
Yeah, their essence. A chair is wood and fabric. A duck is a bird with feathers that quacks.

180
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,780
Sure.

181
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,920
But in Haskell, and in this theory of abstraction, we define things by what they do. The source

182
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,960
calls this an affordance-based ontology.

183
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,480
Affordance. That's a design term, right? A door handle affords pulling. A button affords

184
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:49,940
pushing.

185
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,000
Correct. So in programming, a type class is just a collection of affordances. It's a contract.

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,500
For example, take the concept of EQ, which is short for equality.

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,140
Okay.

188
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,360
In Haskell, to belong to the EQ class, a thing just needs to be able to answer one question.

189
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,300
Are you equal to this other thing?

190
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,360
And it doesn't matter if it's a number, a string of text, or a picture of a cat.

191
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,380
Doesn't matter at all. As long as it has a defined method for checking equality, it is an EQ.

192
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,720
The source uses a great example from mathematics. A ring.

193
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,880
Like a wedding ring.

194
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,400
No, a mathematical one. A ring isn't a specific pile of numbers. A ring is anything that allows

195
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,840
you to add, multiply, and negate. If you can do those three things, you are a ring. It doesn't

196
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,700
matter what you're made of.

197
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,320
So if I'm building a system, I don't need to know what the data is made of. I just need

198
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,240
to know its behavioral certificate.

199
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,680
Behavioral certificate. That is the key phrase.

200
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,360
A type signature in code like map, A, B, A, B, is a guarantee. It's a promise.

201
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,580
Okay. What's that one promise?

202
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:01,860
It promises. If you give me a function that turns an A into a B, and a list of A's, I

203
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,160
promise I will give you back a list of B's. It doesn't tell you how it does it.

204
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,440
Right.

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,800
It doesn't tell you if it uses a loop or recursion or magic elves in the background. It just

206
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,420
guarantees the interaction. It specifies the interface.

207
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,580
And this goes right back to the car dashboard. The dashboard is the type signature of the

208
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:27,040
car. It says, I afford steering and accelerating. It doesn't say, I am a V6 engine with a specific

209
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,860
torque curve.

210
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,500
Yes. But remember the warning from the beginning. You can only have that stable dashboard if the

211
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,440
engine obeys the laws of physics.

212
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,340
Right. If it doesn't just explode.

213
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,900
The source makes a profound metaphysical claim here. An interface is a boundary. It's a wall.

214
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,840
But you cannot build a wall on quicksand.

215
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,180
The quicksand being the messy details underneath. The implementation.

216
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,060
Exactly. If the implementation is unstable, if the engine sometimes explodes, or if the code

217
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,840
sometimes returns a number and sometimes returns a ham sandwich, you cannot have a type signature.

218
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:11,040
You cannot have an interface. Abstraction requires that the layer below it has stabilized.

219
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,380
It has reached its own normal form.

220
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,300
This brings us to a really physical example. I mean, we've been talking about math and code,

221
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,700
which are, you know, abstract.

222
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,220
Right.

223
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,080
But the source pivots to hardware, the actual silicon chips. And it talks about something

224
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,280
called null convention logic, or NCL. This part fascinated me because it challenges the

225
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,900
most basic thing I know about computers, that they run on binary. Zero and one.

226
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,660
In standard synchronous logic, which is what's inside your laptop right now, that is true.

227
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,700
You have a wire. If it has high voltage, it's a one. If it has low voltage, it's a zero.

228
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,160
Simple.

229
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,480
But there's a problem. A huge one, actually. How do you know when the answer is ready?

230
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,060
What do you mean?

231
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,600
Electrons take time to move. They don't teleport. If you check the wire too early, the voltage might

232
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,660
still be rising. It might be halfway up. Is that a zero or a one?

233
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,160
So we use a clock, right? A master clock that ticks and tells everyone, okay, read the data. N-O-W.

234
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,820
Yes. That's the governor. It imposes order. But as chips get faster and bigger, keeping that

235
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,240
clock synchronized across billions of transistors is a nightmare. It burns a huge amount of energy.

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,680
Okay.

237
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,580
NCL is different. It gets rid of the clock entirely. It's asynchronous.

238
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,360
Delay-insensitive logic.

239
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:39,040
Exactly. And it does this by changing what a bit is. Instead of one wire being a zero or one,

240
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,260
NCL uses two wires to represent a single bit.

241
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,100
Two wires. How does that help?

242
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,540
Well, imagine two wires. Let's call them A and B. If wire A is on and B is off, that means zero.

243
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,780
If wire B is on and A is off, that means one.

244
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,280
Okay. That covers zero and one. What if both are off? You didn't mention that.

245
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,100
That is the magic. If both are off, it means null. It means no data. It means I'm thinking.

246
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,120
So the computer has a physical state for, I don't know yet.

247
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:13,240
Yes. It has a state for process. In a standard computer, there is no process state.

248
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,980
Just values that might be wrong until the clock ticks.

249
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:25,020
In NCL, the circuit explicitly waits. It sits in the null state until all the input signals arrive and settle.

250
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,480
Only when the computation is finished does it flip to data, either a zero or a one.

251
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,060
That sounds suspiciously like the lambda calculus again.

252
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,480
The null state is the redex. It's the loaded spring.

253
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,180
It is the physical incarnation of the redex.

254
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,460
The null state represents the tension, the potential of the calculation.

255
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,200
The transition to data is the beta reduction. It's the collapse.

256
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:48,740
Wow.

257
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,760
This proves that abstraction is fundamentally temporal.

258
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,780
Temporal. You mean it takes time.

259
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,580
You cannot abstract something that is instantaneous.

260
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,680
Abstraction takes time. It is an event.

261
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,920
The system must move from null, which is chaos, potential, to data, which is order and stability.

262
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,800
You cannot know the answer until the electrons have physically traversed the gate and settled.

263
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,440
Meaning takes time to form.

264
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,720
That's a great way to put it.

265
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,220
Meaning isn't just there. It has to settle like sediment in water.

266
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,480
Or like concrete setting. You can't build on it until it's hard.

267
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,500
Exactly.

268
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,680
Okay. So we've seen the math with lambda, the code with Haskell, and the hardware with NCL.

269
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:35,780
Now the source gets visual. It introduces a custom geometric language called SpherePop calculus.

270
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,020
This is where we leave the traditional textbooks far behind.

271
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:46,460
SpherePop is the author's attempt to visualize this universal reduction process in 3D space.

272
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,680
It sounds like a genre of music, but describe the visual for us.

273
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,200
Okay. Imagine a vast, empty space.

274
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,320
In this space, you have spheres. These aren't just balls. They are regions of validity. They are bubbles of information.

275
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,700
Like a Venn diagram.

276
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,660
Sort of, but dynamic and in 3D. The language has two fundamental moves. Just two.

277
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,820
Merge and collapse.

278
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,420
Merge and collapse. It sounds like the heartbeat of this entire universe.

279
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,880
It effectively is. Merge is the act of bringing things together. Interaction.

280
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,340
You take two separate spheres. Maybe one represents the concept red, and the other represents the concept apple.

281
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,380
And you push them together. They overlap. They interact.

282
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,780
And collapse. I think I know where this is going.

283
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,200
Collapse is the reduction. It's when that complex, overlapping shape snaps into a new, simpler shape.

284
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
It's the decision. It's the beta reduction.

285
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:45,340
The complex region of red plus apple collapses into a single, stable object. Red apple.

286
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,900
The source mentions piping these spheres through something called semantic DAGs. That's a mouthful.

287
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,920
Let's break it down. DAG stands for directed acyclic graph. It basically means a one-way flow.

288
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,340
Imagine a river.

289
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,020
Okay, I'm picturing a river.

290
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,720
Now imagine putting a series of filters, or maybe water wheels, in that river. That is the pipeline.

291
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,160
You pour raw, messy, data muddy water into the top. That's your input.

292
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,120
As it flows down, it passes through these sphere pop filters.

293
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,800
Each filter merges the data with some rule, some other sphere, and then collapses it.

294
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,140
So it filters out the noise, cleans the water.

295
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,240
It refines the meaning. The source uses a really interesting topological metaphor here.

296
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,420
It says, these filters twist and scale the data. Imagine the data is a lump of Play-Doh.

297
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,840
The pipeline stretches it, twists it, folds it, and squashes it.

298
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,320
This sounds a lot like what I've heard about neural networks. They talk about manifold manipulation.

299
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,320
Exactly. That's precisely what a deep learning model does.

300
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,920
It takes the dough of raw pixel data from thousands of images, which is a complete mess.

301
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:03,780
And it needs it, layer by layer, until all the pictures of dogs are in one nice, smooth lump over here,

302
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,800
and all the pictures of cats are in another lump over there.

303
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,100
And that separation, that's the abstraction.

304
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:18,460
Yes. You have abstracted dogness and catness out of the raw pixels by physically, or I guess geometrically,

305
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,500
crushing the space until the distinction becomes clear and simple.

306
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,540
You've minimized the energy required to tell them apart.

307
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,200
You got it.

308
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,540
Which leads us perfectly to the wetware, the brain.

309
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,760
Because if this is how computers work and this is how math works, the claim is that this is how we work.

310
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,420
The source dives into predictive coding.

311
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,620
This is a really hot topic in neuroscience right now.

312
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,400
The idea is that the brain is not a passive camera.

313
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,220
It doesn't just sit there and record what it sees.

314
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,720
No, it is an active prediction engine.

315
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,680
It's guessing what it's going to see next.

316
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,680
Constantly.

317
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,060
Every single moment.

318
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,300
The brain maintains a mental model of the world.

319
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,920
It projects that model outward.

320
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,560
I expect to see a floor under my feet.

321
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,320
I expect to hear your voice.

322
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,640
I expect this coffee to be hot.

323
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,640
And what happens when the prediction is wrong?

324
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,020
That is called surprise or prediction error.

325
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:20,320
However, in information theory, this is surprisingly pun intended, linked to entropy and free energy, surprise is expensive.

326
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,420
Expensive how?

327
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,300
If I predict a floor and I fall into a hole, that is a massive spike in neural activity.

328
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,140
It's a crisis.

329
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,620
The whole system has to reevaluate.

330
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,100
It burns a lot of metabolic energy.

331
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,360
So the brain wants to minimize surprise.

332
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,560
It wants to be right.

333
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,060
Yes.

334
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,480
And guess what minimizes surprise?

335
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,500
Abstraction.

336
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,540
Abstraction.

337
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,220
How so?

338
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,320
If I have a very detailed, messy model of the world, I'm going to be surprised constantly.

339
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,380
Every shadow, every twitch of a leaf is new data that violates my prediction.

340
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:59,120
But if I abstract the world, if I reduce that tree to just tree, then the twitching leaf doesn't surprise me.

341
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,860
It fits the model of what trees do.

342
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,640
I have compressed the data.

343
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,400
So we ignore details to save energy.

344
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,840
We ignore details to survive.

345
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:15,780
We reduce the infinite complexity of the sensory world into manageably simple objects so that we can predict what they will do.

346
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,260
But the most fascinating part of this section is what it says about the self.

347
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,460
The predictive self.

348
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,320
This part tripped me out a little.

349
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:32,180
The source argues that you, your identity, your personality is just the highest level of this prediction hierarchy.

350
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,700
You are the ultimate abstraction.

351
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,800
I am a summary of my own data.

352
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,480
Think about the timescales.

353
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,520
Your sensory data, the photons hitting your retina, changes every millisecond.

354
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,060
Your motor commands change every second.

355
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,340
Your mood might change every hour or every day.

356
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,360
But you, your name, your core values, your memories...

357
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,940
Those stay pretty constant, yeah.

358
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,720
They are the slowest moving variables in the system.

359
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,840
The self is the stable invariant that explains all the faster moving data below it.

360
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,760
It is the normal form of your life's experiences.

361
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,020
So I am just a story my brain tells itself to make sense of the chaos.

362
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,840
You are the generative model.

363
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
And here is the kicker.

364
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,880
We don't just predict the world.

365
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,600
We act to make the world match our predictions.

366
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,780
Wait, explain that.

367
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,420
I don't follow.

368
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,840
It's called active inference.

369
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,120
If my model says, I am holding a cup of coffee, but my hand is empty, I have a prediction error.

370
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,940
A surprise.

371
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,620
Right.

372
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,700
I have two choices.

373
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,640
I can change my model, which is hard.

374
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
It means admitting I have no coffee, which is sad.

375
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,560
Or I can change the world.

376
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,560
Go pick up a cup.

377
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,540
Go kick up a cup.

378
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,080
So when I brew coffee in the morning, I'm just trying to resolve a math error in my head.

379
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Fundamentally, yes.

380
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:53,380
You are acting to minimize the free energy difference between your internal abstraction and external reality.

381
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,960
We literally terraform the world to fit our abstractions.

382
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,180
That is profound.

383
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,240
And it explains why it's so painful when our identity gets challenged.

384
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,620
If I am just a geometric model, what happens when that model breaks?

385
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,980
The force calls that dissociation.

386
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,020
It describes trauma as a fracture in the geometric manifold of the self.

387
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,720
A fracture.

388
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,480
Imagine your life as a smooth path, what mathematicians call a geodesic, through this state space.

389
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,860
A traumatic event is a discontinuity, a cliff.

390
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,000
The model can't predict across the gap.

391
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,780
So the path just stops.

392
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,000
The self literally breaks apart.

393
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,260
You lose the connection between who I was before the event and who I am now.

394
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,680
It's a failure of abstraction.

395
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,280
You can no longer reduce your experience to a single coherent story.

396
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,200
So healing is geometry repair.

397
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
It's rebuilding the manifold.

398
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,940
Finding a new path that connects the pieces.

399
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,520
It's a reduction of the trauma into a new, stable narrative.

400
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,040
Wow.

401
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,340
Okay, take a breath.

402
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,040
Because we are about to jump from the brain into the absolute deep end.

403
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,540
We are.

404
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,260
Section 6.

405
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,720
The Grand Unification.

406
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,680
The physics.

407
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,540
The physics.

408
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,260
The source stops playing around with metaphors and goes straight for the throat of the universe.

409
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,260
It introduces 5D RSVP Ising models.

410
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,580
Now, I read this section three times and I still feel like I need a PhD to parse it.

411
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,100
Let's break it down gently.

412
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,460
First, what is an Ising model?

413
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,300
Forget the 5D for a second.

414
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,080
An Ising model is a tool physicists use to understand magnetism.

415
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,860
Imagine a crowded dance floor.

416
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,000
Everyone is standing on a perfect grid.

417
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,120
Okay, dance floor.

418
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:37,680
Got it.

419
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,180
Each person can face either north or south.

420
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,060
That's it.

421
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,320
Those are the two states.

422
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,440
Now, imagine there is peer pressure.

423
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,620
Everyone wants to face the same direction as their neighbors.

424
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,100
If I'm facing north, I want my four neighbors to face north.

425
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,820
The informity.

426
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,240
Right.

427
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,520
Energetically, it is cheaper to align.

428
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,540
If I face north and you, my neighbor, face south, there is tension.

429
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,340
There is energy between us.

430
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,960
The system naturally wants to relax into a state where everyone is aligned.

431
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,540
All north or all south.

432
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,060
Right.

433
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,620
That relaxation, that alignment, is the Ising model solving itself.

434
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,760
It's finding its lowest energy state.

435
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,280
Okay, so magnets work by peer pressure.

436
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,780
Atoms lining up to reduce tension.

437
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,580
Exactly.

438
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,840
Now, the source takes this simple grid and explodes it.

439
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,800
It adds dimensions.

440
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,240
It says, our reality isn't just a 3D grid of space.

441
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,860
It proposes a five-dimensional lattice.

442
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,400
What are the extra dimensions?

443
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,600
You have the three spatial dimensions we all know.

444
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
Up, down, left, right, forward, back.

445
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,920
Then you have time.

446
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,760
That's the fourth.

447
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,820
Usual suspect.

448
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,800
And the fifth dimension is semantic depth.

449
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,080
Semantic depth, meaning?

450
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:46,980
Yes.

451
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,000
The scale of the abstraction.

452
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,520
Remember the sphere pop collapse or the neural network layers?

453
00:26:53,260 --> 00:27:00,040
The movement from raw pixels to concept of a dog is a movement through the fifth dimension.

454
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,680
It's movement from detail to abstract.

455
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,960
So, in this model, thinking is a physical movement.

456
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,500
Yes.

457
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,800
And this is the RSVP part.

458
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,280
It defines three fields that permeate this 5D lattice.

459
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,080
There's Sivli Phi, which is a scalar field.

460
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
Think of it like pressure or temperature.

461
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,900
There's Vulva Nu, which is a vector field.

462
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,560
Think of it like flow or momentum.

463
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,820
And there's Sivli, which is entropy.

464
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,640
Bolam.

465
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,360
The plenum.

466
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,300
The background stuff of the universe.

467
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:34,380
The source argues that computation, whether it's in a silicon chip or your brain, is just

468
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:40,040
this 5D fluid relaxing, just like the magnets on the dance floor want to align to minimize

469
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,040
tension, your thoughts want to align to minimize entropy, and, well, surprise, when you are confused,

470
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,440
your mental state is high energy.

471
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,440
It's jagged.

472
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,260
It's unaligned.

473
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,960
When you have an aha moment, when you understand that is the system physically collapsing into

474
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,300
a lower energy state.

475
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,060
So understanding is literally a form of cooling down.

476
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,680
Yes.

477
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,960
The source uses the term Lamford dynamic smoothing.

478
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,460
It's a great phrase.

479
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,380
The universe wants to be smooth.

480
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,960
It hates jagged, high-complexity states.

481
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,300
It constantly tries to smooth them out into abstractions.

482
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,020
This ties right back to the original equation.

483
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,400
Yeah.

484
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,600
Abstraction equals energy minimization.

485
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,140
It's the same force.

486
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,880
Gravity pulls a ball down a hill.

487
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,380
The Ising interaction pulls a magnet into alignment.

488
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,160
And abstraction pulls a raw data stream into a coherent concept.

489
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,760
It is all just the universe trying to find the path of least resistance.

490
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,380
That's incredibly beautiful and also makes me feel very, very small.

491
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,280
But wait, there was a throwaway line in there about unit stochastic matrices and quantum mechanics.

492
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,100
The critique we got said we glossed over this.

493
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,620
What is the connection there?

494
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,640
It's a dense connection.

495
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,400
But let's try it.

496
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,140
Think of it this way.

497
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,820
You know Plato's cave.

498
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,860
The allegory.

499
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,500
Prisoners watching shadows on a wall.

500
00:28:59,600 --> 00:28:59,800
Right.

501
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,440
The shadows are 2D, but the objects casting them are 3D.

502
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,100
You can't see the 3D object, but you can infer its properties from the shadow.

503
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:19,280
The source suggests that classical logic, the step-by-step deduction we do, the A implies B implies C, is just the shadow of a deeper quantum process.

504
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,060
So our logical thoughts are just the shadows of quantum events.

505
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,880
Roughly, yes.

506
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:33,760
A unit stochastic matrix is a mathematical tool that connects classical probability, like rolling dice with quantum amplitude, like waves interfering.

507
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:43,140
The source implies that the semantic depth dimension, that fifth dimension, allows quantum effects to project down into our classical reality.

508
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,780
Thesis.

509
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,120
Our choices might be the collapse of a quantum wave function occurring in that fifth dimension.

510
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:57,500
Our seemingly logical thought process could be the shadow cast by a much richer probabilistic computation happening at a deeper level.

511
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,100
My brain is officially full.

512
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,540
Yeah.

513
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,360
But we can't stop here.

514
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:09,780
Because if we accept all this, that abstraction is this powerful universal force of smoothing and reducing, we have to talk about the cost.

515
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,240
Right.

516
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:10,920
Section 7.

517
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,620
The ethics of abstraction.

518
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,340
This is where the rubber really meets the road.

519
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,420
Because if abstraction is reduction, that means something is being lost.

520
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,840
Something is being deleted.

521
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,860
The source makes a really important distinction between computational abstraction and phenomenological reduction.

522
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,540
That sounds like jargon, but the difference is life and death, isn't it?

523
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,300
It is.

524
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,560
Computational abstraction, what we've been praising this whole time, is about making the world useful.

525
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,240
You strip away the details of the tree to calculate its lumber yield.

526
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,120
You strip away the details of the driver to design the traffic system.

527
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,360
You make the map smaller than the territory so you can use it.

528
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:51,620
Right.

529
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,540
Useful.

530
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,580
Efficient.

531
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,120
Phenomenological reduction is the opposite.

532
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,000
It's what philosophers like Husserl and Heidegger talked about.

533
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,620
It's about stripping away your assumptions to see the world as it truly is.

534
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,780
So it's not about making the map smaller.

535
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,900
No, it's about making the map bigger.

536
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:18,380
It's about seeing the tree not as lumber, but as a living, breathing, complex entity with roots and fungi and a place in an ecosystem.

537
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,500
So one makes the world simple and you could say dead, and the other makes the world complex and alive.

538
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,340
Exactly.

539
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,220
And the dark genealogy the source warns about is what happens when we use computational abstraction on people.

540
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,040
The bureaucratic fallacy.

541
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,400
Reducing a human being to a number.

542
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,600
A statistic.

543
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,460
It's more than just a number.

544
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,700
It's a functional reduction.

545
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,120
The source uses the image of the broken back.

546
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,740
Yeah, that was visceral.

547
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,240
Imagine a pharaoh building a pyramid.

548
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,720
To the pharaoh, the slave is an abstraction.

549
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,240
The slave is a force unit.

550
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,760
The interface is movestone.

551
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,220
The implementation details.

552
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,000
The slave's pain.

553
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,960
Their family.

554
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,660
Their snapped spine.

555
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,720
Are hidden.

556
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,500
They're irrelevant to the function.

557
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,980
They are encapsulated, to use the coding term.

558
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,860
They're encapsulated.

559
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,140
And to the pharaoh, the system is working perfectly.

560
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,300
The stone moved.

561
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,920
The contract was satisfied.

562
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,820
The normal form was achieved.

563
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,920
But the reality is a broken human body.

564
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,940
This is the danger of a clean interface.

565
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,160
It hides the blood.

566
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,800
It hides the dependencies.

567
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,980
This is what the source calls extraction.

568
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,100
Extraction is when you abstract a resource like a forest into a simple commodity like timber,

569
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,600
and you delete the ecological web that keeps the forest alive.

570
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:36,940
Right.

571
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,620
You ignore the soil, the fungi, the water cycle.

572
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,200
You extract the timber, and then the underlying reality collapses.

573
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,620
The forest dies.

574
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,780
Because you tried to run a get timber function on a system that was actually a live forest system.

575
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,660
The abstraction lied.

576
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,460
The abstraction was leaky.

577
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,320
It was a bad model.

578
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,620
It didn't account for the interdependencies that allowed the timber to exist in the first place.

579
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,260
So how do we fix this?

580
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,960
We can't just stop abstracting.

581
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,860
We can't process every atom of the universe individually.

582
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,480
We need maps.

583
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,740
We need models.

584
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,420
We do.

585
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,740
And the source doesn't advocate for that.

586
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,500
Instead, it proposes an ethics of reduction.

587
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,320
It calls for responsible interfaces.

588
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
What does a responsible interface look like?

589
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,380
It looks like an interface that remembers what it deleted.

590
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,980
It stores a memory of the complexity it collapsed.

591
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:35,300
And crucially, it allows the underlying reality to veto the abstraction.

592
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,720
Give me an example of a veto.

593
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,920
Think about an AI hiring system.

594
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,640
It abstracts candidates into a set of scores.

595
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,400
That's efficient.

596
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,800
But a veto would be.

597
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,680
If the system notices that it's rejecting all female candidates,

598
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,060
the underlying reality, the fact of discrimination,

599
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,960
overrides the abstraction of efficiency.

600
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,560
The territory says your map is wrong.

601
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,660
Exactly.

602
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,480
The territory gets to speak.

603
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,440
You have to listen to the friction.

604
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,600
If the engine is screaming, you don't just turn up the radio.

605
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,120
You look under the hood.

606
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,440
We have to be willing to break the abstraction

607
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,140
and look at the mess when people are getting hurt.

608
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,000
That feels like the ultimate lesson here.

609
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,920
Abstraction is a tool, a powerful one,

610
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,740
but it's not a truth.

611
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,060
It is a method of compression.

612
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,280
It is not reality itself.

613
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,740
We have covered a staggering amount of ground today.

614
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:32,220
From the redexes of lambda calculus to the null states of NCL chips.

615
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,280
From the kneading of dough in sphere pop space.

616
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,840
To the five-dimensional physics of the soul.

617
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,620
It's a lot, but I hope the listener sees the thread.

618
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,780
It's all the same thing.

619
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,340
The grand equivalence.

620
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,220
Abstraction equals reduction equals evaluation equals energy minimization.

621
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,960
We are reduction engines.

622
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,220
That is what we are.

623
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,660
We take the infinite noise of the universe and we collapse it into habitable order.

624
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,100
We build a floor to stand on over an abyss of chaos.

625
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,160
Beautifully put.

626
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,080
But we have to remember that the floor is artificial.

627
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,460
And sometimes we need to look through the cracks.

628
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,040
We do.

629
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,440
You always leave us with a thought to chew on.

630
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,900
Something to, you know, keep us up at night.

631
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,740
What does the 5D RSVP Ising model have for us?

632
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,580
Well, let's combine the predictive self with the energy minimization of physics.

633
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:21,980
Okay.

634
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,580
We said that your self is just a model trying to minimize surprise.

635
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,140
And we said that computation is just the universe naturally falling into a lower energy state.

636
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:30,880
Okay.

637
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,980
I'm following.

638
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,160
So usually we think, I am thinking a thought.

639
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,960
I am the agent.

640
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,880
I am doing the work.

641
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,240
Right.

642
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,260
I am the thinker.

643
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,940
But if your thought is just the universe relaxing, if it's just the inevitable slide of that 5D field

644
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,260
into a lower energy valley, then are you thinking?

645
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,400
Or are your thoughts just the sound the universe makes as it settles?

646
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:56,880
Whoa.

647
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,640
Is you.

648
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,320
Your entire identity.

649
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,980
Just the specific geometric shape where the universe found the path of least resistance.

650
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,880
Are you the sculptor or are you just the clay?

651
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,300
Am I the thinker or am I just the place where the thinking happens?

652
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,080
Exactly.

653
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,520
I think.

654
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,980
I think I need to go lie down and minimize my own energy state for a while.

655
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,520
Go find your normal form.

656
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,520
Thank you so much for this journey.

657
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,580
It has been a true deep dive.

658
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,640
To our listeners, good luck with your own reductions.

659
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,040
We'll see you next time.

660
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,700
Bye.

661
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,520
Bye.

662
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,700
Bye.

663
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:29,840
Bye.

664
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,860
Bye.

665
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,780
Bye.

666
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,340
Bye.

667
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,980
Bye.

668
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:38,740
Bye.

669
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,260
Bye.

670
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:39,920
Bye.

671
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,680
Bye.

672
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,180
Bye.

673
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,900
Bye.

674
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,220
Bye.

675
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,560
Bye.

676
