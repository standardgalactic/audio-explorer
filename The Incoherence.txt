Historical Note:
This screenplay dramatizes the intellectual
and political conflicts of 12th-century
al-Andalus, drawing on documented events
and philosophical texts.
LOGLINE
In 12th-century Córdoba, philosopher-physician Ibn Rushd
(Averroes) confronts a series of apparent miracles that
threaten the foundations of rational medicine and law.
When
he discovers the "signs" are being manufactured by the state
to control public belief, he must choose between speaking
the truth that will cost him everything--or protecting the
institutions he has built by remaining silent.
THEMES
THE INCOHERENCE explores the tension between faith and
reason, institutional power and intellectual honesty,
and the vulnerability of knowledge in times of political
crisis.
It examines how authority uses spectacle to replace
argument, and how ideas survive through exile, translation,
and accident rather than triumph.

FADE IN:
1
EXT. CÓRDOBA - MEDICAL SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
Midday.
White Andalusian light fractures across limestone
paving, producing hard-edged shadows that make every surface
legible.
Heat shimmers faintly above the stone, as if the
air itself were breathing.
A low wooden table stands beneath a stretched canvas awning.
On it:
brass instruments laid with deliberate order,
ceramic bowls, folded strips of linen, a shallow basin
of water reflecting a clipped rectangle of sky.
Nothing
decorative.
Everything chosen.
IBN RUSHD -- AVERROES -- early sixties, lean, spare, with
the hands of a man who has spent decades alternating between
pen and blade, sits cross-legged on a cushion.
His fingers
are permanently darkened by ink and medicinal stains.
His
posture is exact, economical.
Before him sits a PATIENT -- forties, laborer, shoulders
thick from work -- his tunic pulled aside to expose a
swollen shoulder joint, skin taut, flushed, angry with heat.
A semicircle of STUDENTS surrounds the table.
Twelve in
number.
Muslim, Jewish, Christian.
Some barely old enough
to shave; others older, hands scarred by former trades.
They watch with varying mixtures of confidence, anxiety, and
hope.
At the back, half in shadow, a figure in a plain student
djellaba sits very still.
Hood drawn.
This is AISHA BINT
RUSHD, nineteen, disguised with practiced ease.
She does
not look away.
Averroes takes the patient's wrist between thumb and
forefinger.
He closes his eyes.
We do not hear a literal pulse.
Instead, the rhythm is
suggested -- a faint emphasis in the ambient sound, almost
imperceptible, syncing breath to beat.
He releases the wrist.
Opens his eyes.
Looks not
immediately at the injury, but at the basin of water,
then the angle of shadow along the courtyard wall.
Time,
measured without display.

3.
AVERROES
(to the students)
The pulse is fast but regular.
The heat is localized.
The skin
is red, not darkened.
This
tells us the body is reacting,
not failing.
A STUDENT -- eager, sharp-featured -- leans forward.
STUDENT
Master, how can we be certain
this reaction is the cause, and
not merely the sign?
Averroes turns his head slowly.
He treats the question as
fragile, not foolish.
AVERROES
Because signs repeat.
Causes
persist.
If you confuse them,
you will chase shadows until the
patient dies of patience.
A few students exchange glances.
One nods.
Another frowns.
STUDENT (CONT'D)
But some say illness is a test.
That the body suffers because
God wishes it so.
A murmur moves through the semicircle -- agreement,
hesitation, relief.
Averroes does not sigh.
He does not rebuke.
He adjusts his
grip on the lancet, grounding himself in the work.
AVERROES
If you believe that, you may
pray.
Prayer is not forbidden
here.
(beat)
But if you stay, you will
observe first.
Intention does
not substitute for attention.
He raises the lancet slightly so all can see it.
The blade
catches the light, precise, unadorned.

4.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
This tool has no theology.
It
cuts whether you are righteous
or cruel.
That is not blasphemy.
That is reliability.
He makes a small, exact incision.
The PATIENT flinches,
then exhales as pressure releases.
Dark, amber-tinged fluid
drains into a waiting cup.
The courtyard holds its breath -- then releases it.
Life
resumes at a lower volume.
AISHA watches closely.
Not the blood.
The angle of entry.
The restraint.
The refusal to dramatize pain.
As Averroes cleans the wound, the camera drifts -- not
insistently -- to a shaded alcove at the courtyard's edge.
There:
a CLEPSYDRA. A simple water clock.
Water drips from
one vessel to another.
Drip.
Drip.
Drip.
The sound is not emphasized.
It is simply present -- as
natural as breath.
AVERROES
(as he works)
When you see suffering, do not
ask first what God intends.
Ask
what the body is doing.
Healing
leaves traces.
So does decay.
(beat)
If you refuse to read those
traces, you will call ignorance
piety and negligence humility.
He finishes, binds the wound, presses gently to ensure
firmness.

5.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
(to the patient)
Clean twice daily.
If the
redness spreads beyond this line,
return immediately.
He traces a careful boundary with his finger.
The patient
nods, grateful, chastened.
The patient is helped away.
Students disperse slowly,
talking in low voices.
AISHA remains seated.
Averroes packs his instruments with
the same care he used to unpack them.
He senses her presence without turning.
A pause -- not
acknowledgment, not denial.
CUT
TO:
2
INT. COURT OF LAW - HALL OF JURISTS - DAY
The same Andalusian light, but disciplined.
It enters
through high lattice windows and breaks into repeating
geometric patterns across the floor.
The air is cooler than
the courtyard, heavier with bodies and restraint.
Rows of JURISTS sit on low benches, robes arranged with
ceremonial care.
Scrolls, tablets, wax seals.
The quiet
here is not peace; it is containment.
At the center, on a raised cushion, sits AVERROES in his
role as QADI. The physician's tools are gone.
In their
place:
a writing tablet, a stylus, a small stack of legal
precedents.
His hands are unchanged.
Ink, medicine, law --
the same fingers, different grammar.
Before him stand two men.
On the left, a BUILDER, mid-fifties, beard dusted
permanently white with lime.
His hands are thick, knuckles
split and healed badly.
On the right, a LABORER, younger,
arm bound tightly, bruises blooming purple and yellow
beneath the cloth.
Between them, an unspoken absence:
a collapsed wall.
A JUNIOR JURIST rises, scroll in hand.
He speaks formally,
but his eyes flick toward Averroes, searching.

6.
JUNIOR JURIST
The matter before the court
concerns injury sustained during
the collapse of a retaining
wall on the eastern works.
The
question is whether fault may be
assigned.
A pause.
The words "fault" and "assigned" hang uneasily.
AVERROES
Let the builder speak.
The BUILDER clears his throat.
He does not look at the
laborer.
He looks upward, just above the jurists' heads,
as if addressing a ceiling that might absolve him.
BUILDER
The wall stood as walls stand.
Stone upon stone.
Mortar mixed
as my father taught me.
It fell
because God willed it to fall.
A murmur ripples through the benches -- not outrage, but
relief.
The phrase lands softly, like a blanket placed over
responsibility.
BUILDER (CONT'D)
Who am I to argue with the
decree of the Most High?
The LABORER shifts.
Pain flickers across his face.
He
speaks hesitantly, unused to rooms like this.
LABORER
I was beneath it, my lord.
I
heard a crack before it fell.
Like dry wood.
The BUILDER stiffens.
BUILDER
Stone cracks when God commands
it.
Averroes lowers his eyes to his tablet.
He marks something
-- a small notation, precise.
AVERROES
How long had the wall stood?

7.
BUILDER
Two seasons.
Nearly three.
AVERROES
And the mortar?
Lime and sand?
BUILDER
As always.
AVERROES
From which quarry came the
stone?
The BUILDER hesitates.
Just a fraction too long.
BUILDER
The northern cut.
Cheaper
transport.
Averroes looks up now.
His gaze is not accusatory.
It is
diagnostic.
AVERROES
The northern stone fractures
along internal seams when
improperly cured.
It demands
thicker mortar and longer
setting time.
The JUNIOR JURIST shifts uncomfortably.
He interjects,
carefully.
JUNIOR JURIST
Qadi, if I may -- does this not
presume that the wall obeys
necessity rather than divine
immediacy?
The room tightens.
Several heads turn.
This is the
dangerous sentence.
Averroes does not answer immediately.
He looks instead at
the LABORER's bound arm.
AVERROES
If I said the arm broke because
God willed it, would you refuse
the splint?
A ripple of unease.

8.
JUNIOR JURIST
No, my lord, but--
AVERROES
Then you already believe that
God's will includes consistency.
(beat)
Law cannot function if injury is
inscrutable.
If every collapse
is miracle, then no craft exists
-- only luck and prayer.
He turns to the BUILDER.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
You chose cheaper stone.
You
reduced mortar.
You hurried the
setting.
These are causes.
(beat)
God did not conceal them from
you.
The BUILDER's jaw tightens.
His defense is slipping,
replaced by something like resentment.
A SENIOR JURIST leans toward his neighbor, whispers -- not
quite inaudible.
SENIOR JURIST
Careful.
He speaks as if the
world binds even Heaven.
Averroes hears.
He does not respond to the whisper.
He
writes.
AVERROES
Judgment:
negligence.
Compensation is owed.
The
injured man will receive wages
for the season lost, paid by the
builder's guild.
The stylus presses firmly.
Final.
The LABORER exhales, relief and disbelief mingled.
The
BUILDER bows stiffly, anger contained.
As the parties withdraw, the JUNIOR JURIST remains standing.

9.
JUNIOR JURIST
Qadi...
forgive me.
But some
will say that this ruling limits
God.
Averroes looks at him -- really looks.
AVERROES
No.
It limits excuses.
The JUNIOR JURIST absorbs this, unsettled.
As the court moves to the next case, the camera drifts again
-- to the side wall.
There, recessed into stone, another CLEPSYDRA. Same rhythm.
Drip.
Drip.
But now the sound feels louder.
More noticeable.
Time as
obligation.
CUT
TO:
3
EXT. CÓRDOBA - STREET OUTSIDE THE COURT - DAY
The court doors open onto noise.
Not chaos, but density
-- vendors calling, carts creaking, voices overlapping in
practiced disorder.
The city breathes differently than the
courtroom.
AVERROES steps out, flanked briefly by two COURT SCRIBES who
peel away without ceremony.
Authority dissolves the moment
it exits architecture.
Across the street, a small CROWD has gathered around a
PREACHER. He stands atop an overturned crate, robes rough,
voice well-trained for outrage and reassurance in equal
measure.
PREACHER
--and who are we to say why a
wall falls or a child sickens?
Are we builders of fate?
Are we
physicians of decree?
A few listeners murmur assent.

10.
PREACHER (CONT'D)
No.
We are servants.
And
servants do not ask how the
Master moves His hand.
Averroes slows, not intentionally.
The words catch him like
grit in the shoe.
AISHA, still hooded, has emerged from the crowd behind
him.
She keeps distance, watching both the preacher and
her father with equal intensity.
PREACHER (CONT'D)
Beware those who tell you that
stone remembers weight and that
flesh obeys rules.
They replace
wonder with arrogance and call
it knowledge.
The PREACHER's eyes flick briefly toward Averroes.
Recognition, sharpened by rumor.
PREACHER (CONT'D)
There are men in this city who
would rather measure God than
fear Him.
A murmur swells.
Not a shout.
Something worse -- agreement
without commitment.
Averroes stops.
He turns.
For a moment, it seems he might
speak.
AISHA's breath catches.
He does not speak.
He looks instead at a nearby CHILD,
no more than eight, watching the preacher with open
concentration, as if trying to memorize the cadence rather
than the meaning.
Averroes turns away.
AISHA falls into step beside him as they walk.
AISHA
You could have answered him.
AVERROES
I answered him this morning.
In
a room that required listening.

11.
AISHA
He speaks where listening is
optional.
They pass a PUBLIC FOUNTAIN. Water pours steadily from a
lion's mouth into a basin.
Women fill jars.
Children
splash.
Averroes watches the flow for half a beat longer than
necessary.
AVERROES
When argument leaves law and
enters appetite, it becomes
spectacle.
AISHA
Spectacle is faster.
Averroes says nothing.
As they move on, the camera lingers on the fountain.
The
flow is steady.
Ordinary.
Reliable.
For now.

INT. AVERROES' STUDY - LATE AFTERNOON
A high-ceilinged room lined with books -- philosophy, law,
medicine -- arranged not by prestige but by use.
Margins
crowded with notes in several hands.
Sunlight slants low through a lattice window, illuminating
dust and the spine of a large manuscript:
TAH¯AFUT
AL-FAL¯ASIFA.
Averroes sits at a low desk.
Before him:
blank parchment.
He does not yet write.
AISHA removes her hood.
Her hair is bound tightly,
scholar's discipline more than disguise.
AISHA
They are repeating it in the
market.
That you bind God with
stone and sinew.

12.
AVERROES
Then they misunderstand both God
and stone.
He finally dips his pen.
Writes the title deliberately:
TAH¯AFUT AL-TAH¯AFUT.
AISHA
You are answering a book written
before I was born.
AVERROES
I am answering its consequences.
He pauses, rubs his fingers.
Ink stains, old scars.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
Al-Ghaz¯ali was sincere.
That is
what makes him dangerous.
AISHA
And you?
Averroes considers the question more seriously than it may
deserve.
AVERROES
I am precise.
That may be
worse.
A knock at the door.
A SERVANT enters, hesitant.
SERVANT
Master, there is talk -- in Fez.
At al-Qarawiyy¯ın.
AISHA's eyes sharpen at the name.
SERVANT (CONT'D)
They say the jurists there still
teach law beside astronomy.
That a woman founded the place,
long ago.
Averroes looks up, surprised despite himself.
AVERROES
F¯atima al-Fihri.
Yes.
A faint smile -- brief, private.

13.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
When institutions remember their
origins, they resist decay a
little longer.
AISHA
Do you think they would hear you
there?
Averroes does not answer immediately.
AVERROES
Fez listens.
Bologna debates.
Córdoba...
He gestures vaguely, encompassing the city beyond the walls.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
Córdoba believes it already
knows.
Outside, distant shouting rises -- not violent, but charged.
Averroes returns his attention to the page.
Begins to write
in earnest.
The scratch of the pen becomes rhythmic, almost percussive.
The camera drifts again -- to the corner of the room.
The CLEPSYDRA. Drip.
Drip.
Time passes.
Something is being set in motion.
CUT
TO:

14.
3A
EXT. CÓRDOBA - MARKET DISTRICT - LATE AFTERNOON
The market is dense and loud.
Canvas awnings sag under the
weight of heat.
Flies hover.
Merchants shout prices with
theatrical despair.
SALADIN, early 30s, dark-skinned, broad-shouldered, moves
through the crowd carrying a basket for his MASTER, who
follows several paces behind, distracted by bargaining.
Saladin wears a slave's collar -- plain leather, practical,
unornamented.
Saladin's eyes are alert, not fearful.
He watches
everything.
Near a bread stall, a STREET URCHIN -- twelve, barefoot,
sharp-eyed -- waits.
He watches the BAKER argue with a
CUSTOMER.
In one smooth motion, the boy lifts a flat loaf and two
figs.
He disappears into the crowd like a fish slipping
water.
Saladin sees it.
Their eyes meet for half a heartbeat.
The boy freezes --
then keeps moving.
Saladin does nothing.
Not mercy.
Not defiance.
Calculation.
The Baker never notices.
The transaction finishes.
Life
resumes.
Saladin exhales quietly.
MASTER
Did you see that boy lingering?
Saladin lowers his eyes.
SALADIN
No, master.
The MASTER grunts, uninterested.
They move on.
CUT
TO:

15.
3B
INT. MASTER'S COURTYARD - NIGHT
A different silence.
Harder.
Torches flicker against
stone.
Saladin kneels.
His MASTER stands above him, flanked by two
HOUSE GUARDS. One holds a short, heavy sword -- practical,
not ceremonial.
On the ground between them lies the stolen loaf.
Half-eaten.
Discovered too late to matter.
MASTER
The baker says you saw.
Saladin does not deny it.
SALADIN
I saw hunger.
The MASTER laughs once -- sharply.
MASTER
You saw theft.
And you chose
not to see it.
He turns to the GUARD.
MASTER (CONT'D)
If the world works without
consequence, then discipline
dissolves.
Saladin looks up.
Not pleading.
Understanding.
The sword flashes.
We do not see the cut.
We hear it.
A wet, final sound.
Saladin collapses sideways, clutching his arm.
Blood pools
fast, dark, undeniable.
The MASTER steps back, satisfied but not cruel -- merely
restored.

16.
MASTER (CONT'D)
Let this remind you:
witnessing
is action.
Saladin's breath comes ragged.
His eyes stay open, fixed on
the torchlight wavering on stone.
For the first time, causality is undeniable.
CUT
TO:
4
EXT. CÓRDOBA - PUBLIC FOUNTAIN AT THE WESTERN SQUARE -
DAY
The square is fuller than usual.
Not festive -- attentive.
People stand in loose rings, pretending to be occupied while
watching the same place.
At the center, the PUBLIC FOUNTAIN. The same lion's mouth.
The same basin.
SALADIN stands at the edge of the crowd, his right sleeve
pinned and empty.
His posture has changed.
He now stands
slightly sideways, as if the city has pushed him out of
alignment.
AISHA is present as well, hood up again, eyes alert.
A COURT OFFICIAL confers quietly with a pair of CITY WORKERS
near the fountain.
The exchange is subtle, efficient.
No
one looks religious.
A hush spreads -- not commanded, but anticipated.
The call to prayer begins from a nearby minaret.
The sound
rolls across the square in long, familiar waves.
As the first phrase reaches its apex, the water in the
fountain hesitates.
Then -- impossibly -- it begins to flow upward.
Not violently.
Calmly.
As if reconsidering gravity.
Gasps.
Someone laughs nervously.
Someone drops a jug.

17.
ONLOOKER
Praise be --
Saladin stares.
His breathing quickens.
AISHA does not react outwardly.
She watches the pipes at
the fountain's base.
The workers.
The timing.
The water climbs for several seconds -- long enough to be
undeniable -- then resumes its ordinary fall.
The square erupts.
PREACHER
You see?
You see how small the
laws of men are?
Saladin drops to his knees.
Not in joy.
In terror.
Averroes is not present.
His absence is conspicuous.
CUT
TO:
5
INT. AVERROES' STUDY - NIGHT
The room is darker now.
Lamps lit.
Scrolls open.
The
manuscript grows.
Averroes writes, pauses, crosses out a line, rewrites.
He
is not agitated -- but the pen moves more slowly.
AISHA enters, breathless.
AISHA
Father.
At the fountain.
AVERROES
Describe it.
She does.
Precisely.
Timing.
Sound.
Crowd behavior.
Averroes listens without interruption.
When she finishes,
he closes his eyes briefly.
AVERROES
Did the water return to its
level?

18.
AISHA
Yes.
AVERROES
Did anything else change?
AISHA
Only the people.
Averroes exhales.
Not relief.
Calculation.
AVERROES
Then the pipes are intact.
AISHA studies him.
AISHA
You sound certain.
AVERROES
I sound unfinished.
He rises, takes a small oil lamp, moves to the wall where
architectural diagrams hang.
He traces a finger along a
conduit sketch -- Roman-era engineering.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
Pressure reversed briefly.
Enough to astonish.
Not enough
to flood.
AISHA absorbs this.
AISHA
They chose prayer time.
AVERROES
Of course they did.
A knock.
ZAYNAB enters -- physician, composed, grave.
ZAYNAB
Two patients refused treatment
today.
Said the fountain cured
their doubt.
She notices the diagrams.

19.
ZAYNAB (CONT'D)
So.
It begins.
Averroes returns to his desk.
He writes a heading.
On the Necessity of Causes.
The clepsydra sounds louder now.
Drip.
Drip.

6
EXT. SIDE STREET - DAWN
Saladin sits against a wall, wrapped in a filthy cloak.
Begging bowl empty.
A child -- the same STREET URCHIN -- passes.
He slows.
Recognizes Saladin.
The boy places half a loaf into the bowl.
Hesitates.
Then
places the figs.
Saladin looks up.
Their eyes meet again.
SALADIN
Did the water rise?
STREET URCHIN
Yes.
Everyone saw.
SALADIN
Then God is very close.
The boy nods, uncertain, and runs.
Saladin stares at his empty sleeve.
At the bread.
He does not eat immediately.
In the distance, bells and calls mingle -- competing rhythms
of meaning.

INT. GOVERNOR'S CHANCELLERY - DAY
A room without ornament.
Maps, ledgers, sealed jars of ink.
The architecture is administrative rather than sacred.
The GOVERNOR'S SECRETARY stands at a table, consulting a
parchment covered in neat columns.
Beside him, a MILITARY
CAPTAIN waits, helmet under his arm.
SECRETARY
The fountain worked better than
expected.
Word reached the
northern quarter within the
hour.
CAPTAIN
No flooding.
No damage.
SECRETARY
Good.
A miracle that requires
repairs is not persuasive.
He marks a column.
SECRETARY (CONT'D)
What of the Philosopher?
CAPTAIN
Not present.
His daughter was.
Watching the pipes.
The SECRETARY pauses.
Makes a note.
SECRETARY
She should not watch too
closely.
He rolls the parchment, sets it aside, unseals another.
SECRETARY (CONT'D)
Prepare the fire demonstration.
Quietly.
I want no chanting
this time.
Awe decays if it
repeats too loudly.
CAPTAIN
And the Prosecutor?
A small smile.

21.
SECRETARY
He believes.
Belief is
expensive.
We will spend it
carefully.

EXT. SUBURBAN YARD - NIGHT
A secluded space behind a dyer's workshop.
Torches gutter.
A MAN stands shirtless, his chest wrapped in pale cloth.
A DYE-MASTER applies a paste with a practiced hand.
Mineral
fibers glint faintly in the torchlight.
DYE-MASTER
Do not move once you are wrapped.
Heat will find the gaps.
The man nods.
He is not devout.
He is paid.

INT. MOSQUE PORTICO - DAY
The ASHARITE PROSECUTOR stands before a gathering.
His
voice is calm, sincere, resonant.
PROSECUTOR
We are told the world is a

But what if fire burns only
because God remembers to command
it?
The crowd leans forward.
PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)
Today, you will see that
remembrance.

Coals glow.
Heat ripples

The WRAPPED MAN steps forward.
He hesitates -- then places
his hand into the flame.
Gasps.
The cloth does not burn.
Saladin watches from the edge.
His face tightens.
AISHA watches the cloth.
The silence.
The absence of
sound.
Averroes is not present.
Again.

Averroes listens as AISHA recounts the fire.
AVERROES
Did the cloth crackle?
AISHA
No.
AVERROES
Then it was not cloth.
He reaches for a mineral sample, fingers testing its weight.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
They are not breaking nature.
They are exploiting ignorance.
He looks tired now.
Not frightened.
AVERROES (CONT'D)
Which means they are serious.

The fire miracle is being reenacted verbally.
Embellished.

Saladin listens as merchants argue.
MERCHANT

SECOND MERCHANT

Afraid.
Saladin looks down at his stump.
Flexes phantom fingers.
He whispers, not prayer, not disbelief.
SALADIN
I saw the cause.

The manuscript grows heavier.
Margins dense.
Averroes writes:
a rebuttal to occasionalism, careful,

counterpoint.
Outside, distant chanting rises -- not angry yet.
Expectant.

Unmoved.

INT. MOSQUE LIBRARY - NIGHT
A narrow room lined with chained volumes.
Oil lamps throw
uneven light, creating islands of clarity amid shadow.
The ASHARITE PROSECUTOR stands alone, rereading notes from
his own sermon.
His confidence has thinned.
He pauses over
a phrase, then crosses it out.
A faint sound reaches him -- metal on stone.
Rhythmic.
Measured.
He turns.
Sees a CLEPSYDRA tucked into an alcove,
forgotten.
Water drips steadily.
He watches it longer than necessary.
PROSECUTOR
(to himself)
If the drip does not lie...
He closes the book, disturbed by the thought rather than
comforted.

INT. CALIPH'S PRIVATE GARDEN - NIGHT
Water channels cross the marble floor in perfect geometry.
The sound is soothing, controlled.
The CALIPH walks slowly beside AVERROES. No guards.
No
scribes.
This is not court; it is consequence.
CALIPH
They are saying you deny wonder.
AVERROES
I deny fraud.
CALIPH
To the crowd, those are
indistinguishable.
The Caliph stops, looks at the water flowing through the
channels.

25.
CALIPH (CONT'D)
Fez still teaches law and stars
in the same breath.
Bologna
debates itself into paralysis.
Córdoba...
fears becoming
either.
Averroes recognizes the warning embedded in the comparison.
AVERROES
If the state teaches people
that cause is illusion, it also
teaches them that responsibility
is illusion.
CALIPH
Responsibility is expensive.
Awe is cheap.
A pause.
CALIPH (CONT'D)
Do not force my hand.

Something hard passes between them.
