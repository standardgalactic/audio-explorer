WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.060
Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today we are doing something a little, uh, a little different.

00:06.220 --> 00:07.240
A lot different, I'd say.

00:07.240 --> 00:11.940
Yeah, that's fair. Usually we take a topic, say, you know, the history of the shipping container

00:11.940 --> 00:17.640
or the nuances of microbiome science, and we really drill down into the specifics.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.120
Right, we find one thread and pull on it.

00:20.160 --> 00:27.240
Exactly. But today we're going to try to drill down into, well, everything. All of it.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.240
The machinery of reality itself.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.340
It's ambitious, to say the least.

00:32.460 --> 00:33.760
That is putting it mildly.

00:34.560 --> 00:40.100
The source material for this Deep Dive is a dense, sprawling monograph titled,

00:40.640 --> 00:45.740
Abstraction is Reduction. A Unified Account of Evaluation, Structure, and Proof.

00:46.740 --> 00:50.240
And I have to admit, when I first saw that title, my eyes kind of glazed over.

00:50.240 --> 00:56.000
I thought, okay, great. Another dry, academic slog through obscure computer science theory.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.240
I was, uh, I was ready to cancel the recording session.

00:59.340 --> 01:03.160
I don't blame you. Abstraction as Reduction sounds like the kind of thing you'd read if

01:03.160 --> 01:06.120
you're having trouble sleeping. It just sounds incredibly dry.

01:06.440 --> 01:11.820
It does. But then I started reading the notes you sent over, and I realized my initial reaction

01:11.820 --> 01:15.780
was, well, it was exactly the problem the book is trying to solve.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.700
Oh, how so?

01:16.780 --> 01:21.060
I was looking at the surface and just completely ignoring the engine underneath.

01:21.060 --> 01:23.940
This isn't just about code, is it?

01:24.120 --> 01:27.860
No, not at all. It uses code as a language, sure. It has to use some language.

01:28.140 --> 01:33.940
But the argument here is that the principles governing how a computer program runs

01:33.940 --> 01:38.960
are the exact same principles governing how your brain processes trauma,

01:39.300 --> 01:44.360
how a magnet organizes its fields, and even how we make ethical decisions.

01:44.620 --> 01:44.860
Oh.

01:44.860 --> 01:47.760
It's a grand unified theory of structure.

01:48.020 --> 01:53.080
That's the hook that got me. The idea that there is a single mathematical move,

01:53.900 --> 01:59.040
one specific action that explains all these different layers of reality. So let's start

01:59.040 --> 02:01.400
with that title concept, abstraction.

02:01.740 --> 02:02.020
Okay.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.620
When I use that word in, you know, just casual conversation, I usually mean vague,

02:05.940 --> 02:10.340
or I mean a shortcut. Like, I drive a car, he's a steering wheel on the pedals. That's

02:10.340 --> 02:15.160
the abstraction. I don't need to know how the fuel injection timing works or the thermodynamics

02:15.160 --> 02:20.880
of the combustion chamber. The abstraction hides the messy details so I can just get to

02:20.880 --> 02:21.620
the grocery store.

02:21.740 --> 02:26.100
That is the conventional view. That is what you'll find in almost every computer science

02:26.100 --> 02:31.220
textbook or, you know, philosophy intro. We tend to think of abstraction as a shield.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.220
A shield, yeah.

02:32.220 --> 02:39.380
It's a protective layer that hides complexity. You treat the car as a single object car, so

02:39.380 --> 02:42.160
you don't have to treat it as 10,000 moving parts.

02:42.820 --> 02:45.160
It's a mental coping mechanism.

02:45.700 --> 02:52.940
But the author of this monograph, a researcher who goes by fliction, he argues that this view

02:52.940 --> 02:56.140
is fundamentally backward, or at least it's missing the mechanism.

02:56.560 --> 02:56.940
Backward.

02:56.940 --> 03:02.400
He argues that abstraction isn't just hiding details. It is a reductional act.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.620
A reductional act.

03:03.720 --> 03:08.880
It is a physical, almost destructive process where degrees of freedom are eliminated.

03:09.180 --> 03:14.660
Destructive is a strong word. You're saying that when I abstract the car, I am destroying

03:14.660 --> 03:15.260
something.

03:15.460 --> 03:20.400
In a sense, yes. Think about it energetically. You said you don't need to know about the engine

03:20.400 --> 03:21.560
to drive. Why?

03:21.880 --> 03:22.820
Because it just works.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.340
Because the engine has been engineered. It has been constrained.

03:26.340 --> 03:32.200
The pistons can only move in a specific way. The fuel can only ignite at a specific time.

03:32.780 --> 03:39.680
The abstraction of the steering wheel is only possible because the utter chaos of a controlled

03:39.680 --> 03:43.380
explosion has been ruthlessly reduced into linear motion.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.580
You can't abstract a pile of burning gasoline. You can only abstract an engine.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.840
I see. So abstraction isn't about me ignoring the details. It's about the system itself having

03:54.840 --> 03:58.820
crushed those details into a stable shape that allows me to ignore them.

03:59.060 --> 04:04.460
Precisely. And that brings us to the core thesis. You cannot abstract something that is still

04:04.460 --> 04:11.180
thinking or still resolving its internal conflicts. Abstraction is what happens after the conflict

04:11.180 --> 04:11.880
is resolved.

04:12.140 --> 04:13.940
So that's the mission of this deep dive then.

04:13.940 --> 04:20.380
Exactly. To trace the single principle that to abstract is to reduce from the simplest math

04:20.380 --> 04:23.820
all the way up to high dimensional physics and even ethics.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.820
And there's an equation for this, right? I know, you know, audio format, math is hard.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.720
But this one seems simple enough that even I could wrap my head around it.

04:32.720 --> 04:37.980
It is the backbone of the entire work. And it's more of an equivalence, really. The equation is

04:37.980 --> 04:43.940
abstraction equals reduction equals computation equals energy minimization.

04:44.480 --> 04:50.420
Okay. Abstraction, reduction, computation, and then energy minimization. That's where it gets weird

04:50.420 --> 04:50.740
for me.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.220
Yeah. That's where it leaves the computer lab.

04:53.280 --> 04:58.900
Right. I get that computation is reduction. I think we'll get into that. But are we really saying

04:58.900 --> 05:03.760
that solving a math problem is the same thing as a ball rolling down a hill?

05:03.760 --> 05:09.240
We are. The source argues they are structurally identical. Whether it is a student solving for

05:09.240 --> 05:15.500
X, a neuron firing to recognize a face, or a physical system settling into a crystal lattice,

05:15.680 --> 05:17.260
the process is the same.

05:17.380 --> 05:17.880
Which is what?

05:18.220 --> 05:25.160
High complexity, high energy, and high uncertainty collapse into a stable, simpler, low energy form.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.920
That collapse, that is abstraction.

05:27.920 --> 05:33.080
Okay. That is a massive claim. To prove it, we have to start at the very bottom.

05:33.140 --> 05:33.580
The beginning.

05:33.820 --> 05:39.620
The source takes us back to the 1930s, before modern computers even existed, to something

05:39.620 --> 05:45.400
called the lambda calculus. Now, I know the name sounds like a fraternity, but this is Alonzo

05:45.400 --> 05:50.700
Church's work. Why do we start here? Why not with, say, Turing machines?

05:50.700 --> 05:56.460
It's a great question. Because Turing machines, which are the model for standard computers,

05:56.800 --> 06:01.620
are mechanical. They have tape. They have heads that read and write. They have states.

06:01.820 --> 06:02.700
They feel like machines?

06:03.040 --> 06:08.380
They do. They feel like little factories. Lambda calculus is different. The source calls it the

06:08.380 --> 06:14.340
embryo of computation. It has no hard drive. It has no loops. It has no data types. It doesn't even

06:14.340 --> 06:16.340
have numbers, strictly speaking.

06:16.620 --> 06:17.720
So what does it have? What's left?

06:17.960 --> 06:23.520
It just has functions. And it has variables. And it has the ability to apply a function to

06:23.520 --> 06:26.580
a variable. That's it. It's pure substitution.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.060
It sounds almost too simple to be useful.

06:29.460 --> 06:32.200
And yet, it can compute anything that can be computed.

06:32.560 --> 06:32.680
Yeah.

06:32.680 --> 06:38.040
But the reason the source focuses on it is because of how it handles work. Work. In lambda

06:38.040 --> 06:44.500
calculus, there is a concept called the redex. That's R-E-D-E-X. It stands for a reducible

06:44.500 --> 06:45.240
expression.

06:45.340 --> 06:45.900
A redex.

06:46.400 --> 06:53.260
Imagine a box that contains a rule, a function. And sitting right next to it is a value. That

06:53.260 --> 06:57.140
pairing the rule and the input waiting to be processed is a redex.

06:57.340 --> 06:58.500
So it's potential energy?

06:58.500 --> 07:01.900
Exactly. It represents work that needs to be done.

07:02.020 --> 07:03.380
So it's like a loaded spring.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.140
Hmm.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.960
Or a mousetrap that's been set.

07:06.180 --> 07:12.220
A loaded spring is the perfect analogy. And the act of computation in this system is called

07:12.220 --> 07:14.880
better reduction. Beta reduction.

07:15.000 --> 07:15.600
Beta reduction.

07:15.680 --> 07:20.640
It's the act of triggering the spring. You take the value, you shove it into the function,

07:21.040 --> 07:27.700
you execute the rule, and the box, the function, and the value disappears. You are left with just

07:27.700 --> 07:28.320
the result.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.560
So you're destroying the instruction and replacing it with the answer.

07:31.720 --> 07:37.800
Yes. And you keep doing this. If the answer you get contains another redex, another loaded

07:37.800 --> 07:39.880
spring, you trigger that one too.

07:40.040 --> 07:40.300
Right.

07:40.460 --> 07:46.600
You keep collapsing these boxes one by one until there are no more redexes left.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.500
And what happens when you run out of redexes?

07:48.600 --> 07:48.720
Yeah.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.500
When all the springs have sprung?

07:50.500 --> 07:58.300
You reach what is called normal form. This is a critical concept. A term is in normal form when

07:58.300 --> 08:04.100
it can no longer be reduced. It is, for all intents and purposes, dead. It is static.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.740
That sounds kind of grim. Dead.

08:06.960 --> 08:12.420
It's grim if you're a romantic, but it's wonderful if you're a mathematician. Normal form is just

08:12.420 --> 08:13.780
another name for the answer.

08:14.420 --> 08:14.800
Okay.

08:14.800 --> 08:20.760
When you ask, what is two plus two? Two plus two is the redex. It's the tension. It's the loaded

08:20.760 --> 08:23.660
spring. Four is the normal form.

08:23.780 --> 08:24.120
I see.

08:24.400 --> 08:30.380
Four isn't a computation. Four is a value. The source says it is the corpse of a computation

08:30.380 --> 08:31.280
that has finished.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.700
So to abstract something is to kill it.

08:33.920 --> 08:39.520
To abstract something is to resolve it, to finish the work. The source argues that you can only treat

08:39.520 --> 08:45.180
four as a stable, reliable object because you aren't constantly recalculating it. If four was

08:45.180 --> 08:49.800
unstable, if it sometimes equaled five, you couldn't build anything on top of it. You couldn't do

08:49.800 --> 08:50.240
accounting.

08:50.240 --> 08:55.820
This connects directly to the next section, which uses an analogy everyone will hype, but everyone

08:55.820 --> 08:57.920
understands. Algebra homework.

08:58.260 --> 09:02.980
Algebra as interface literacy. It's brilliant because it takes this high theory of computer

09:02.980 --> 09:04.920
science and puts it right in a classroom.

09:04.920 --> 09:12.540
Right. So say I had the equation $3 plus five equals 21er. When I was in school, I just thought

09:12.540 --> 09:17.140
of this as a puzzle. I need to move the numbers around until I get X alone.

09:17.240 --> 09:22.380
And that moving numbers around is literally manual beta reduction. You are the computer.

09:22.620 --> 09:22.960
Oh, wow.

09:23.080 --> 09:29.480
You write $3 equals 15 one eyes. That's one reduction step. You write sex X equals five five. That's the

09:29.480 --> 09:32.180
final reduction. You have reached normal form.

09:32.180 --> 09:37.620
But the source makes a point here about showing your work. My teachers were obsessed with that. I

09:37.620 --> 09:39.780
always thought they were just being sadistic, you know.

09:39.820 --> 09:44.520
They were asking you to expose the intermediate reduction steps. They wanted to see the read X's

09:44.520 --> 09:49.940
before they collapsed. But there is a deeper philosophical point here that the source makes.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.360
The equation $3 plus five isn't just a puzzle.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.360
What is it then?

09:54.360 --> 09:57.200
It is a functional contract.

09:57.340 --> 09:57.900
A contract.

09:58.120 --> 10:05.420
Yes. Think about it. That equation defines a relationship. It defines a constraint on reality.

10:05.620 --> 10:12.400
It says, I will only accept a value for X that when you triple it and add five to it yields exactly

10:12.400 --> 10:13.980
20. It's like a lock.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.220
It's a strict gateway. A very specific lock.

10:17.500 --> 10:17.680
Yeah.

10:17.680 --> 10:22.980
Solving the equation is the process of finding the one thing in the universe that can satisfy

10:22.980 --> 10:25.420
that contract. The one key that fits.

10:25.560 --> 10:30.440
So the answer five is the only thing that fits the shape of the hole created by the question.

10:30.580 --> 10:35.720
Exactly. And once you have the answer five, you can throw away the equation. You don't need the

10:35.720 --> 10:39.920
complexity of $3 plus five equals $20 anymore. You can just use five.

10:39.980 --> 10:41.080
That is the abstraction.

10:41.080 --> 10:47.420
That's it. You have replaced a complex relationship with a simple identity. You have reduced the

10:47.420 --> 10:53.280
degrees of freedom from any number in existence down to this specific number.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.640
This feels like it bridges really nicely into the world of software engineering because if

10:57.640 --> 11:01.780
algebra is doing this manually, coding is just automating it.

11:01.980 --> 11:02.100
Right.

11:02.420 --> 11:08.220
The source spends a lot of time on the programming language Haskell and this idea of type classes.

11:08.220 --> 11:12.440
Now, I know our audience isn't all software engineers, so let's keep this conceptual.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.660
What does a type class tell us about the nature of reality?

11:16.940 --> 11:23.440
Well, it tells us about how we define things. In the old way of thinking, maybe the platonic

11:23.440 --> 11:26.300
way we define things by what they are. Their essence.

11:26.600 --> 11:33.280
Yeah, their essence. A chair is wood and fabric. A duck is a bird with feathers that quacks.

11:33.460 --> 11:33.780
Sure.

11:33.780 --> 11:39.920
But in Haskell, and in this theory of abstraction, we define things by what they do. The source

11:39.920 --> 11:42.960
calls this an affordance-based ontology.

11:43.280 --> 11:49.480
Affordance. That's a design term, right? A door handle affords pulling. A button affords

11:49.480 --> 11:49.940
pushing.

11:50.480 --> 11:56.000
Correct. So in programming, a type class is just a collection of affordances. It's a contract.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.500
For example, take the concept of EQ, which is short for equality.

12:01.880 --> 12:02.140
Okay.

12:02.540 --> 12:07.360
In Haskell, to belong to the EQ class, a thing just needs to be able to answer one question.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.300
Are you equal to this other thing?

12:10.420 --> 12:14.360
And it doesn't matter if it's a number, a string of text, or a picture of a cat.

12:14.460 --> 12:19.380
Doesn't matter at all. As long as it has a defined method for checking equality, it is an EQ.

12:19.380 --> 12:23.720
The source uses a great example from mathematics. A ring.

12:24.100 --> 12:24.880
Like a wedding ring.

12:25.040 --> 12:30.400
No, a mathematical one. A ring isn't a specific pile of numbers. A ring is anything that allows

12:30.400 --> 12:35.840
you to add, multiply, and negate. If you can do those three things, you are a ring. It doesn't

12:35.840 --> 12:36.700
matter what you're made of.

12:37.060 --> 12:41.320
So if I'm building a system, I don't need to know what the data is made of. I just need

12:41.320 --> 12:43.240
to know its behavioral certificate.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.680
Behavioral certificate. That is the key phrase.

12:45.680 --> 12:52.360
A type signature in code like map, A, B, A, B, is a guarantee. It's a promise.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.580
Okay. What's that one promise?

12:53.720 --> 13:01.860
It promises. If you give me a function that turns an A into a B, and a list of A's, I

13:01.860 --> 13:06.160
promise I will give you back a list of B's. It doesn't tell you how it does it.

13:06.220 --> 13:06.440
Right.

13:06.600 --> 13:11.800
It doesn't tell you if it uses a loop or recursion or magic elves in the background. It just

13:11.800 --> 13:15.420
guarantees the interaction. It specifies the interface.

13:15.420 --> 13:20.580
And this goes right back to the car dashboard. The dashboard is the type signature of the

13:20.580 --> 13:27.040
car. It says, I afford steering and accelerating. It doesn't say, I am a V6 engine with a specific

13:27.040 --> 13:27.860
torque curve.

13:28.160 --> 13:34.500
Yes. But remember the warning from the beginning. You can only have that stable dashboard if the

13:34.500 --> 13:36.440
engine obeys the laws of physics.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.340
Right. If it doesn't just explode.

13:38.680 --> 13:44.900
The source makes a profound metaphysical claim here. An interface is a boundary. It's a wall.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.840
But you cannot build a wall on quicksand.

13:48.300 --> 13:52.180
The quicksand being the messy details underneath. The implementation.

13:52.560 --> 13:59.060
Exactly. If the implementation is unstable, if the engine sometimes explodes, or if the code

13:59.060 --> 14:04.840
sometimes returns a number and sometimes returns a ham sandwich, you cannot have a type signature.

14:05.060 --> 14:11.040
You cannot have an interface. Abstraction requires that the layer below it has stabilized.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.380
It has reached its own normal form.

14:14.820 --> 14:19.300
This brings us to a really physical example. I mean, we've been talking about math and code,

14:19.400 --> 14:20.700
which are, you know, abstract.

14:20.980 --> 14:21.220
Right.

14:21.600 --> 14:27.080
But the source pivots to hardware, the actual silicon chips. And it talks about something

14:27.080 --> 14:33.280
called null convention logic, or NCL. This part fascinated me because it challenges the

14:33.280 --> 14:38.900
most basic thing I know about computers, that they run on binary. Zero and one.

14:39.260 --> 14:43.660
In standard synchronous logic, which is what's inside your laptop right now, that is true.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.700
You have a wire. If it has high voltage, it's a one. If it has low voltage, it's a zero.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.160
Simple.

14:48.160 --> 14:53.480
But there's a problem. A huge one, actually. How do you know when the answer is ready?

14:54.620 --> 14:55.060
What do you mean?

14:55.060 --> 15:01.600
Electrons take time to move. They don't teleport. If you check the wire too early, the voltage might

15:01.600 --> 15:05.660
still be rising. It might be halfway up. Is that a zero or a one?

15:05.980 --> 15:13.160
So we use a clock, right? A master clock that ticks and tells everyone, okay, read the data. N-O-W.

15:13.480 --> 15:19.820
Yes. That's the governor. It imposes order. But as chips get faster and bigger, keeping that

15:19.820 --> 15:25.240
clock synchronized across billions of transistors is a nightmare. It burns a huge amount of energy.

15:25.400 --> 15:25.680
Okay.

15:26.020 --> 15:29.580
NCL is different. It gets rid of the clock entirely. It's asynchronous.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.360
Delay-insensitive logic.

15:31.520 --> 15:39.040
Exactly. And it does this by changing what a bit is. Instead of one wire being a zero or one,

15:39.260 --> 15:42.260
NCL uses two wires to represent a single bit.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.100
Two wires. How does that help?

15:44.100 --> 15:50.540
Well, imagine two wires. Let's call them A and B. If wire A is on and B is off, that means zero.

15:50.980 --> 15:53.780
If wire B is on and A is off, that means one.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.280
Okay. That covers zero and one. What if both are off? You didn't mention that.

15:57.320 --> 16:02.100
That is the magic. If both are off, it means null. It means no data. It means I'm thinking.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.120
So the computer has a physical state for, I don't know yet.

16:06.460 --> 16:13.240
Yes. It has a state for process. In a standard computer, there is no process state.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.980
Just values that might be wrong until the clock ticks.

16:17.940 --> 16:25.020
In NCL, the circuit explicitly waits. It sits in the null state until all the input signals arrive and settle.

16:25.760 --> 16:30.480
Only when the computation is finished does it flip to data, either a zero or a one.

16:30.580 --> 16:33.060
That sounds suspiciously like the lambda calculus again.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.480
The null state is the redex. It's the loaded spring.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.180
It is the physical incarnation of the redex.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.460
The null state represents the tension, the potential of the calculation.

16:44.160 --> 16:48.200
The transition to data is the beta reduction. It's the collapse.

16:48.620 --> 16:48.740
Wow.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.760
This proves that abstraction is fundamentally temporal.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.780
Temporal. You mean it takes time.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.580
You cannot abstract something that is instantaneous.

16:56.980 --> 16:58.680
Abstraction takes time. It is an event.

16:58.680 --> 17:04.920
The system must move from null, which is chaos, potential, to data, which is order and stability.

17:05.300 --> 17:09.800
You cannot know the answer until the electrons have physically traversed the gate and settled.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.440
Meaning takes time to form.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.720
That's a great way to put it.

17:14.140 --> 17:18.220
Meaning isn't just there. It has to settle like sediment in water.

17:18.600 --> 17:21.480
Or like concrete setting. You can't build on it until it's hard.

17:21.980 --> 17:22.500
Exactly.

17:22.500 --> 17:27.680
Okay. So we've seen the math with lambda, the code with Haskell, and the hardware with NCL.

17:27.800 --> 17:35.780
Now the source gets visual. It introduces a custom geometric language called SpherePop calculus.

17:36.100 --> 17:39.020
This is where we leave the traditional textbooks far behind.

17:39.780 --> 17:46.460
SpherePop is the author's attempt to visualize this universal reduction process in 3D space.

17:46.580 --> 17:49.680
It sounds like a genre of music, but describe the visual for us.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.200
Okay. Imagine a vast, empty space.

17:52.500 --> 17:59.320
In this space, you have spheres. These aren't just balls. They are regions of validity. They are bubbles of information.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.700
Like a Venn diagram.

18:01.180 --> 18:06.660
Sort of, but dynamic and in 3D. The language has two fundamental moves. Just two.

18:06.920 --> 18:07.820
Merge and collapse.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.420
Merge and collapse. It sounds like the heartbeat of this entire universe.

18:11.660 --> 18:16.880
It effectively is. Merge is the act of bringing things together. Interaction.

18:16.880 --> 18:23.340
You take two separate spheres. Maybe one represents the concept red, and the other represents the concept apple.

18:23.540 --> 18:26.380
And you push them together. They overlap. They interact.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.780
And collapse. I think I know where this is going.

18:29.140 --> 18:35.200
Collapse is the reduction. It's when that complex, overlapping shape snaps into a new, simpler shape.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.200
It's the decision. It's the beta reduction.

18:38.820 --> 18:45.340
The complex region of red plus apple collapses into a single, stable object. Red apple.

18:45.340 --> 18:51.900
The source mentions piping these spheres through something called semantic DAGs. That's a mouthful.

18:52.100 --> 18:57.920
Let's break it down. DAG stands for directed acyclic graph. It basically means a one-way flow.

18:58.420 --> 18:59.340
Imagine a river.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.020
Okay, I'm picturing a river.

19:01.020 --> 19:06.720
Now imagine putting a series of filters, or maybe water wheels, in that river. That is the pipeline.

19:07.300 --> 19:12.160
You pour raw, messy, data muddy water into the top. That's your input.

19:12.500 --> 19:16.120
As it flows down, it passes through these sphere pop filters.

19:16.760 --> 19:20.800
Each filter merges the data with some rule, some other sphere, and then collapses it.

19:20.980 --> 19:23.140
So it filters out the noise, cleans the water.

19:23.300 --> 19:27.240
It refines the meaning. The source uses a really interesting topological metaphor here.

19:27.240 --> 19:33.420
It says, these filters twist and scale the data. Imagine the data is a lump of Play-Doh.

19:33.820 --> 19:37.840
The pipeline stretches it, twists it, folds it, and squashes it.

19:37.840 --> 19:43.320
This sounds a lot like what I've heard about neural networks. They talk about manifold manipulation.

19:43.780 --> 19:47.320
Exactly. That's precisely what a deep learning model does.

19:47.800 --> 19:54.920
It takes the dough of raw pixel data from thousands of images, which is a complete mess.

19:54.920 --> 20:03.780
And it needs it, layer by layer, until all the pictures of dogs are in one nice, smooth lump over here,

20:03.960 --> 20:07.800
and all the pictures of cats are in another lump over there.

20:07.900 --> 20:10.100
And that separation, that's the abstraction.

20:10.300 --> 20:18.460
Yes. You have abstracted dogness and catness out of the raw pixels by physically, or I guess geometrically,

20:18.860 --> 20:22.500
crushing the space until the distinction becomes clear and simple.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.540
You've minimized the energy required to tell them apart.

20:25.720 --> 20:26.200
You got it.

20:26.380 --> 20:29.540
Which leads us perfectly to the wetware, the brain.

20:29.980 --> 20:35.760
Because if this is how computers work and this is how math works, the claim is that this is how we work.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.420
The source dives into predictive coding.

20:38.680 --> 20:41.620
This is a really hot topic in neuroscience right now.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.400
The idea is that the brain is not a passive camera.

20:44.780 --> 20:47.220
It doesn't just sit there and record what it sees.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.720
No, it is an active prediction engine.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.680
It's guessing what it's going to see next.

20:52.160 --> 20:52.680
Constantly.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.060
Every single moment.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.300
The brain maintains a mental model of the world.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.920
It projects that model outward.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.560
I expect to see a floor under my feet.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.320
I expect to hear your voice.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.640
I expect this coffee to be hot.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.640
And what happens when the prediction is wrong?

21:08.800 --> 21:12.020
That is called surprise or prediction error.

21:12.020 --> 21:20.320
However, in information theory, this is surprisingly pun intended, linked to entropy and free energy, surprise is expensive.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.420
Expensive how?

21:21.540 --> 21:27.300
If I predict a floor and I fall into a hole, that is a massive spike in neural activity.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.140
It's a crisis.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.620
The whole system has to reevaluate.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.100
It burns a lot of metabolic energy.

21:33.260 --> 21:35.360
So the brain wants to minimize surprise.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.560
It wants to be right.

21:36.740 --> 21:37.060
Yes.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.480
And guess what minimizes surprise?

21:40.020 --> 21:40.500
Abstraction.

21:41.140 --> 21:41.540
Abstraction.

21:41.660 --> 21:42.220
How so?

21:42.400 --> 21:47.320
If I have a very detailed, messy model of the world, I'm going to be surprised constantly.

21:47.540 --> 21:52.380
Every shadow, every twitch of a leaf is new data that violates my prediction.

21:52.380 --> 21:59.120
But if I abstract the world, if I reduce that tree to just tree, then the twitching leaf doesn't surprise me.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.860
It fits the model of what trees do.

22:01.140 --> 22:02.640
I have compressed the data.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.400
So we ignore details to save energy.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.840
We ignore details to survive.

22:07.840 --> 22:15.780
We reduce the infinite complexity of the sensory world into manageably simple objects so that we can predict what they will do.

22:15.940 --> 22:20.260
But the most fascinating part of this section is what it says about the self.

22:20.520 --> 22:21.460
The predictive self.

22:22.220 --> 22:24.320
This part tripped me out a little.

22:24.680 --> 22:32.180
The source argues that you, your identity, your personality is just the highest level of this prediction hierarchy.

22:32.860 --> 22:34.700
You are the ultimate abstraction.

22:34.940 --> 22:36.800
I am a summary of my own data.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.480
Think about the timescales.

22:39.180 --> 22:43.520
Your sensory data, the photons hitting your retina, changes every millisecond.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.060
Your motor commands change every second.

22:46.540 --> 22:49.340
Your mood might change every hour or every day.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.360
But you, your name, your core values, your memories...

22:53.360 --> 22:54.940
Those stay pretty constant, yeah.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.720
They are the slowest moving variables in the system.

22:58.180 --> 23:02.840
The self is the stable invariant that explains all the faster moving data below it.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.760
It is the normal form of your life's experiences.

23:06.020 --> 23:10.020
So I am just a story my brain tells itself to make sense of the chaos.

23:10.220 --> 23:11.840
You are the generative model.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.200
And here is the kicker.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.880
We don't just predict the world.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.600
We act to make the world match our predictions.

23:17.980 --> 23:18.780
Wait, explain that.

23:18.980 --> 23:19.420
I don't follow.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.840
It's called active inference.

23:20.840 --> 23:27.120
If my model says, I am holding a cup of coffee, but my hand is empty, I have a prediction error.

23:27.400 --> 23:27.940
A surprise.

23:28.320 --> 23:28.620
Right.

23:28.820 --> 23:29.700
I have two choices.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.640
I can change my model, which is hard.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.500
It means admitting I have no coffee, which is sad.

23:36.060 --> 23:37.560
Or I can change the world.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.560
Go pick up a cup.

23:38.680 --> 23:39.540
Go kick up a cup.

23:39.540 --> 23:44.080
So when I brew coffee in the morning, I'm just trying to resolve a math error in my head.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.400
Fundamentally, yes.

23:46.020 --> 23:53.380
You are acting to minimize the free energy difference between your internal abstraction and external reality.

23:53.860 --> 23:57.960
We literally terraform the world to fit our abstractions.

23:58.060 --> 23:59.180
That is profound.

23:59.180 --> 24:04.240
And it explains why it's so painful when our identity gets challenged.

24:04.860 --> 24:09.620
If I am just a geometric model, what happens when that model breaks?

24:10.240 --> 24:11.980
The force calls that dissociation.

24:12.640 --> 24:17.020
It describes trauma as a fracture in the geometric manifold of the self.

24:17.160 --> 24:17.720
A fracture.

24:17.960 --> 24:23.480
Imagine your life as a smooth path, what mathematicians call a geodesic, through this state space.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.860
A traumatic event is a discontinuity, a cliff.

24:26.860 --> 24:30.000
The model can't predict across the gap.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.780
So the path just stops.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.000
The self literally breaks apart.

24:34.380 --> 24:38.260
You lose the connection between who I was before the event and who I am now.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.680
It's a failure of abstraction.

24:41.360 --> 24:45.280
You can no longer reduce your experience to a single coherent story.

24:45.480 --> 24:48.200
So healing is geometry repair.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.080
It's rebuilding the manifold.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.940
Finding a new path that connects the pieces.

24:52.940 --> 24:57.520
It's a reduction of the trauma into a new, stable narrative.

24:57.780 --> 24:58.040
Wow.

24:59.380 --> 25:00.340
Okay, take a breath.

25:00.820 --> 25:04.040
Because we are about to jump from the brain into the absolute deep end.

25:04.120 --> 25:04.540
We are.

25:04.620 --> 25:05.260
Section 6.

25:05.540 --> 25:06.720
The Grand Unification.

25:07.000 --> 25:07.680
The physics.

25:07.980 --> 25:08.540
The physics.

25:09.080 --> 25:13.260
The source stops playing around with metaphors and goes straight for the throat of the universe.

25:13.860 --> 25:18.260
It introduces 5D RSVP Ising models.

25:18.260 --> 25:22.580
Now, I read this section three times and I still feel like I need a PhD to parse it.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.100
Let's break it down gently.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.460
First, what is an Ising model?

25:27.120 --> 25:28.300
Forget the 5D for a second.

25:28.420 --> 25:32.080
An Ising model is a tool physicists use to understand magnetism.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.860
Imagine a crowded dance floor.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.000
Everyone is standing on a perfect grid.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.120
Okay, dance floor.

25:37.380 --> 25:37.680
Got it.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.180
Each person can face either north or south.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.060
That's it.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.320
Those are the two states.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.440
Now, imagine there is peer pressure.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.620
Everyone wants to face the same direction as their neighbors.

25:47.620 --> 25:51.100
If I'm facing north, I want my four neighbors to face north.

25:51.200 --> 25:51.820
The informity.

25:52.040 --> 25:52.240
Right.

25:52.940 --> 25:55.520
Energetically, it is cheaper to align.

25:56.360 --> 26:00.540
If I face north and you, my neighbor, face south, there is tension.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.340
There is energy between us.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.960
The system naturally wants to relax into a state where everyone is aligned.

26:07.180 --> 26:08.540
All north or all south.

26:08.700 --> 26:09.060
Right.

26:09.240 --> 26:13.620
That relaxation, that alignment, is the Ising model solving itself.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.760
It's finding its lowest energy state.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.280
Okay, so magnets work by peer pressure.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.780
Atoms lining up to reduce tension.

26:21.060 --> 26:21.580
Exactly.

26:22.420 --> 26:25.840
Now, the source takes this simple grid and explodes it.

26:25.960 --> 26:26.800
It adds dimensions.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.240
It says, our reality isn't just a 3D grid of space.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.860
It proposes a five-dimensional lattice.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.400
What are the extra dimensions?

26:34.540 --> 26:36.600
You have the three spatial dimensions we all know.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.640
Up, down, left, right, forward, back.

26:39.000 --> 26:39.920
Then you have time.

26:40.140 --> 26:40.760
That's the fourth.

26:40.940 --> 26:41.820
Usual suspect.

26:41.820 --> 26:44.800
And the fifth dimension is semantic depth.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.080
Semantic depth, meaning?

26:46.560 --> 26:46.980
Yes.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.000
The scale of the abstraction.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.520
Remember the sphere pop collapse or the neural network layers?

26:53.260 --> 27:00.040
The movement from raw pixels to concept of a dog is a movement through the fifth dimension.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.680
It's movement from detail to abstract.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.960
So, in this model, thinking is a physical movement.

27:06.240 --> 27:06.500
Yes.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.800
And this is the RSVP part.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.280
It defines three fields that permeate this 5D lattice.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.080
There's Sivli Phi, which is a scalar field.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.840
Think of it like pressure or temperature.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.900
There's Vulva Nu, which is a vector field.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.560
Think of it like flow or momentum.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.820
And there's Sivli, which is entropy.

27:25.200 --> 27:25.640
Bolam.

27:25.800 --> 27:26.360
The plenum.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.300
The background stuff of the universe.

27:28.300 --> 27:34.380
The source argues that computation, whether it's in a silicon chip or your brain, is just

27:34.380 --> 27:40.040
this 5D fluid relaxing, just like the magnets on the dance floor want to align to minimize

27:40.040 --> 27:46.040
tension, your thoughts want to align to minimize entropy, and, well, surprise, when you are confused,

27:46.280 --> 27:48.440
your mental state is high energy.

27:48.760 --> 27:49.440
It's jagged.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.260
It's unaligned.

27:50.480 --> 27:55.960
When you have an aha moment, when you understand that is the system physically collapsing into

27:55.960 --> 27:57.300
a lower energy state.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.060
So understanding is literally a form of cooling down.

28:00.400 --> 28:00.680
Yes.

28:01.540 --> 28:04.960
The source uses the term Lamford dynamic smoothing.

28:05.580 --> 28:06.460
It's a great phrase.

28:06.660 --> 28:08.380
The universe wants to be smooth.

28:08.940 --> 28:12.960
It hates jagged, high-complexity states.

28:13.260 --> 28:16.300
It constantly tries to smooth them out into abstractions.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.020
This ties right back to the original equation.

28:19.240 --> 28:19.400
Yeah.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.600
Abstraction equals energy minimization.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.140
It's the same force.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.880
Gravity pulls a ball down a hill.

28:25.880 --> 28:29.380
The Ising interaction pulls a magnet into alignment.

28:30.060 --> 28:34.160
And abstraction pulls a raw data stream into a coherent concept.

28:34.660 --> 28:38.760
It is all just the universe trying to find the path of least resistance.

28:38.840 --> 28:42.380
That's incredibly beautiful and also makes me feel very, very small.

28:42.780 --> 28:47.280
But wait, there was a throwaway line in there about unit stochastic matrices and quantum mechanics.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.100
The critique we got said we glossed over this.

28:50.220 --> 28:51.620
What is the connection there?

28:51.780 --> 28:52.640
It's a dense connection.

28:52.820 --> 28:53.400
But let's try it.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.140
Think of it this way.

28:54.800 --> 28:55.820
You know Plato's cave.

28:56.240 --> 28:56.860
The allegory.

28:57.580 --> 28:59.500
Prisoners watching shadows on a wall.

28:59.600 --> 28:59.800
Right.

29:00.060 --> 29:03.440
The shadows are 2D, but the objects casting them are 3D.

29:03.440 --> 29:08.100
You can't see the 3D object, but you can infer its properties from the shadow.

29:08.100 --> 29:19.280
The source suggests that classical logic, the step-by-step deduction we do, the A implies B implies C, is just the shadow of a deeper quantum process.

29:19.280 --> 29:23.060
So our logical thoughts are just the shadows of quantum events.

29:23.200 --> 29:23.880
Roughly, yes.

29:24.500 --> 29:33.760
A unit stochastic matrix is a mathematical tool that connects classical probability, like rolling dice with quantum amplitude, like waves interfering.

29:34.420 --> 29:43.140
The source implies that the semantic depth dimension, that fifth dimension, allows quantum effects to project down into our classical reality.

29:43.460 --> 29:43.780
Thesis.

29:43.960 --> 29:49.120
Our choices might be the collapse of a quantum wave function occurring in that fifth dimension.

29:49.280 --> 29:57.500
Our seemingly logical thought process could be the shadow cast by a much richer probabilistic computation happening at a deeper level.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.100
My brain is officially full.

29:59.320 --> 29:59.540
Yeah.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.360
But we can't stop here.

30:01.520 --> 30:09.780
Because if we accept all this, that abstraction is this powerful universal force of smoothing and reducing, we have to talk about the cost.

30:09.920 --> 30:10.240
Right.

30:10.360 --> 30:10.920
Section 7.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.620
The ethics of abstraction.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.340
This is where the rubber really meets the road.

30:15.340 --> 30:19.420
Because if abstraction is reduction, that means something is being lost.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.840
Something is being deleted.

30:21.360 --> 30:28.860
The source makes a really important distinction between computational abstraction and phenomenological reduction.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.540
That sounds like jargon, but the difference is life and death, isn't it?

30:33.820 --> 30:34.300
It is.

30:34.440 --> 30:39.560
Computational abstraction, what we've been praising this whole time, is about making the world useful.

30:39.560 --> 30:44.240
You strip away the details of the tree to calculate its lumber yield.

30:44.780 --> 30:48.120
You strip away the details of the driver to design the traffic system.

30:48.460 --> 30:51.360
You make the map smaller than the territory so you can use it.

30:51.520 --> 30:51.620
Right.

30:52.020 --> 30:52.540
Useful.

30:53.140 --> 30:53.580
Efficient.

30:54.260 --> 30:56.120
Phenomenological reduction is the opposite.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.000
It's what philosophers like Husserl and Heidegger talked about.

31:00.500 --> 31:04.620
It's about stripping away your assumptions to see the world as it truly is.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.780
So it's not about making the map smaller.

31:06.780 --> 31:08.900
No, it's about making the map bigger.

31:09.340 --> 31:18.380
It's about seeing the tree not as lumber, but as a living, breathing, complex entity with roots and fungi and a place in an ecosystem.

31:18.800 --> 31:24.500
So one makes the world simple and you could say dead, and the other makes the world complex and alive.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.340
Exactly.

31:25.580 --> 31:31.220
And the dark genealogy the source warns about is what happens when we use computational abstraction on people.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.040
The bureaucratic fallacy.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.400
Reducing a human being to a number.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.600
A statistic.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.460
It's more than just a number.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.700
It's a functional reduction.

31:40.520 --> 31:43.120
The source uses the image of the broken back.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.740
Yeah, that was visceral.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.240
Imagine a pharaoh building a pyramid.

31:48.020 --> 31:50.720
To the pharaoh, the slave is an abstraction.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.240
The slave is a force unit.

31:53.900 --> 31:55.760
The interface is movestone.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.220
The implementation details.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.000
The slave's pain.

32:00.240 --> 32:00.960
Their family.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.660
Their snapped spine.

32:02.920 --> 32:03.720
Are hidden.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.500
They're irrelevant to the function.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.980
They are encapsulated, to use the coding term.

32:08.040 --> 32:08.860
They're encapsulated.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.140
And to the pharaoh, the system is working perfectly.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.300
The stone moved.

32:12.460 --> 32:13.920
The contract was satisfied.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.820
The normal form was achieved.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.920
But the reality is a broken human body.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.940
This is the danger of a clean interface.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.160
It hides the blood.

32:23.160 --> 32:24.800
It hides the dependencies.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.980
This is what the source calls extraction.

32:27.700 --> 32:33.100
Extraction is when you abstract a resource like a forest into a simple commodity like timber,

32:33.340 --> 32:36.600
and you delete the ecological web that keeps the forest alive.

32:36.720 --> 32:36.940
Right.

32:36.940 --> 32:39.620
You ignore the soil, the fungi, the water cycle.

32:39.620 --> 32:43.200
You extract the timber, and then the underlying reality collapses.

32:43.700 --> 32:44.620
The forest dies.

32:45.100 --> 32:50.780
Because you tried to run a get timber function on a system that was actually a live forest system.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.660
The abstraction lied.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.460
The abstraction was leaky.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.320
It was a bad model.

32:56.680 --> 33:01.620
It didn't account for the interdependencies that allowed the timber to exist in the first place.

33:01.620 --> 33:03.260
So how do we fix this?

33:03.500 --> 33:05.960
We can't just stop abstracting.

33:05.960 --> 33:09.860
We can't process every atom of the universe individually.

33:10.180 --> 33:11.480
We need maps.

33:11.820 --> 33:12.740
We need models.

33:13.040 --> 33:13.420
We do.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.740
And the source doesn't advocate for that.

33:15.940 --> 33:18.500
Instead, it proposes an ethics of reduction.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.320
It calls for responsible interfaces.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.840
What does a responsible interface look like?

33:23.960 --> 33:26.380
It looks like an interface that remembers what it deleted.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.980
It stores a memory of the complexity it collapsed.

33:29.980 --> 33:35.300
And crucially, it allows the underlying reality to veto the abstraction.

33:35.580 --> 33:36.720
Give me an example of a veto.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.920
Think about an AI hiring system.

33:39.340 --> 33:41.640
It abstracts candidates into a set of scores.

33:41.860 --> 33:42.400
That's efficient.

33:42.760 --> 33:43.800
But a veto would be.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.680
If the system notices that it's rejecting all female candidates,

33:48.120 --> 33:51.060
the underlying reality, the fact of discrimination,

33:51.700 --> 33:53.960
overrides the abstraction of efficiency.

33:54.420 --> 33:56.560
The territory says your map is wrong.

33:57.020 --> 33:57.660
Exactly.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.480
The territory gets to speak.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.440
You have to listen to the friction.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.600
If the engine is screaming, you don't just turn up the radio.

34:05.140 --> 34:06.120
You look under the hood.

34:06.700 --> 34:09.440
We have to be willing to break the abstraction

34:09.440 --> 34:12.140
and look at the mess when people are getting hurt.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.000
That feels like the ultimate lesson here.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.920
Abstraction is a tool, a powerful one,

34:18.080 --> 34:19.740
but it's not a truth.

34:19.860 --> 34:21.060
It is a method of compression.

34:21.580 --> 34:23.280
It is not reality itself.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.740
We have covered a staggering amount of ground today.

34:26.340 --> 34:32.220
From the redexes of lambda calculus to the null states of NCL chips.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.280
From the kneading of dough in sphere pop space.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.840
To the five-dimensional physics of the soul.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.620
It's a lot, but I hope the listener sees the thread.

34:40.860 --> 34:41.780
It's all the same thing.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.340
The grand equivalence.

34:44.020 --> 34:48.220
Abstraction equals reduction equals evaluation equals energy minimization.

34:48.640 --> 34:49.960
We are reduction engines.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.220
That is what we are.

34:51.640 --> 34:55.660
We take the infinite noise of the universe and we collapse it into habitable order.

34:55.900 --> 34:59.100
We build a floor to stand on over an abyss of chaos.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.160
Beautifully put.

35:00.160 --> 35:03.080
But we have to remember that the floor is artificial.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.460
And sometimes we need to look through the cracks.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.040
We do.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.440
You always leave us with a thought to chew on.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.900
Something to, you know, keep us up at night.

35:12.320 --> 35:16.740
What does the 5D RSVP Ising model have for us?

35:17.060 --> 35:21.580
Well, let's combine the predictive self with the energy minimization of physics.

35:21.760 --> 35:21.980
Okay.

35:21.980 --> 35:25.580
We said that your self is just a model trying to minimize surprise.

35:25.800 --> 35:30.140
And we said that computation is just the universe naturally falling into a lower energy state.

35:30.620 --> 35:30.880
Okay.

35:31.300 --> 35:31.980
I'm following.

35:32.420 --> 35:37.160
So usually we think, I am thinking a thought.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.960
I am the agent.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.880
I am doing the work.

35:41.020 --> 35:41.240
Right.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.260
I am the thinker.

35:42.400 --> 35:48.940
But if your thought is just the universe relaxing, if it's just the inevitable slide of that 5D field

35:48.940 --> 35:52.260
into a lower energy valley, then are you thinking?

35:52.700 --> 35:56.400
Or are your thoughts just the sound the universe makes as it settles?

35:56.560 --> 35:56.880
Whoa.

35:57.060 --> 35:57.640
Is you.

35:58.060 --> 35:59.320
Your entire identity.

35:59.320 --> 36:03.980
Just the specific geometric shape where the universe found the path of least resistance.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.880
Are you the sculptor or are you just the clay?

36:07.280 --> 36:10.300
Am I the thinker or am I just the place where the thinking happens?

36:10.680 --> 36:11.080
Exactly.

36:11.220 --> 36:11.520
I think.

36:11.660 --> 36:14.980
I think I need to go lie down and minimize my own energy state for a while.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.520
Go find your normal form.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.520
Thank you so much for this journey.

36:18.860 --> 36:20.580
It has been a true deep dive.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.640
To our listeners, good luck with your own reductions.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.040
We'll see you next time.

36:25.040 --> 36:25.700
Bye.

36:25.700 --> 36:26.520
Bye.

36:28.140 --> 36:29.700
Bye.

36:29.780 --> 36:29.840
Bye.

36:29.980 --> 36:30.860
Bye.

36:31.280 --> 36:31.780
Bye.

36:31.860 --> 36:32.340
Bye.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.980
Bye.

36:38.380 --> 36:38.740
Bye.
