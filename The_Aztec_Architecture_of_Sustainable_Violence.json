{"text": " Welcome back to The Deep Dive. I am so glad you are here with us today because we are about to open a file that, and I'm not exaggerating here, it kept me up half the night. Oh yeah. Yeah. We are looking at a stack of documents that has completely, and I mean completely, rewired how I think about history, about war, and maybe even about how we design the systems we live in today. It's a fascinating and frankly a pretty challenging collection. We're doing a deep dive into a set of documents titled Flower Wars, and this isn't, you know, your standard history textbook. Not at all. We have a screenplay, a very dense character compendium, and then this highly theoretical, almost philosophical interpretive essay by an author named Fliction, and it's dated February 9, 2026. So fresh off the press, in theory, and look, usually when we talk about the Aztec Flower Wars, or the Mexica as they call themselves, we have this very specific, almost Hollywood image, right? We all know it. We think of religious rituals, we think of these incredible feathered costumes, temples reaching to the sky, and let's be real, we think of barbaric spectacles of violence. Absolutely. The dominant cultural meme is, well, it's brutal, its heart's being ripped out on top of a pyramid while the crowd cheers. That's the image burned into our collective consciousness. Right. And the standard historical narrative, it almost always defaults to superstition. It's about bloodthirsty gods demanding tribute, and a society trapped in this cycle of primal fear. It frames the Mexica as, well, as irrational actors driven entirely by religious fervor. Which is, I mean, it's a compelling story, but it's also a bit simplistic, isn't it? Almost lets us off the hook. We can just say, oh, they were savages and not think any deeper. Exactly. But these sources, man, they just flip that script entirely. They ask a very provocative, almost modern question. What if these wars weren't about unleashed violence? What if they were a sophisticated control system designed to limit violence? That is the aha moment for me. That was the line that made me sit up straight. The hook here is war as an engineering problem. We think of war as chaos, as a total breakdown of order. But this essay, it argues that the flower wars were an attempt to impose order on chaos, to design a war the way you might design, I don't know, a dam or a traffic grid. It sounds like a total contradiction. But as we get into this, it starts to make this frighteningly good sense. It does. The central premise here is that civilization is constantly fighting against entropy, against disorder, exhaustion, the inevitable decay of systems. That's a big concept, entropy. It's huge. And this material, it frames the entire civilization, not as a cult. I don't think of documents. A man named Classell, he isn't portrayed as a mystic or some kind of wild-eyed prophet. In the character compendium, he's described as a logistical accountant and a systems engineer. I love that characterization, the logistical accountant of violence. It's so dry, but it's also terrifying. He's not looking at the stars for answers. He's looking at the spreadsheets. He's looking at the input and the output of bodies. Exactly. And his problem is the problem of all civilizations, really. Yeah. How do you stop yourself from burning out? How do you manage your own success so it doesn't kill you? So our mission today is to explore this architecture of violence. Can a civilization save itself from self-destruction by turning war into a game with a very strict set of rules? And, maybe more importantly, what happens when a player shows up who refuses to play by those rules? That is the tragedy at the heart of this story. So, let's start where the documents start. Let's look at the entropy of Conquest. Why even build this system in the first place? Right. Part one. Why build it? And to understand the why, we really have to look at the opening scene of the screenplay. It sets the tone so perfectly. It's night. Tlacalel is sitting in his, you know, modest home. He's not praying. He's not sharpening a sword. He's counting stones. Obsidian counting stones. And his wife, Sitlali, who provides this great sort of grounding presence in the story, she asks him what the numbers are saying. She can see he's stressed, hunched over by the firelight, and she just wants the bottom line of what's wrong. And Tlacalel delivers the core problem of the entire empire in one single devastating line. He says, we take more men than the maize fields replace. Victories are getting heavier. Victories are getting heavier. Oh, that is such a heavy line. It's this chilling realization that you can actually win yourself to death. You can be so successful that you collapse under the weight of your own conquests. And that's what the essay refers to as the problem of infinite war versus finite resources. Or, to put it even more starkly, maize versus men. Maze versus men. Explain that a bit more. Well, the empire is successful, right? They're the dominant power. They're conquering their neighbors left and right. But every single conquest costs lives. And not just the enemy's lives, but their own experienced elite soldiers. The ones who are hardest to replace. Exactly. And it costs energy. It costs resources. You have to march the army there. You have to feed the army. You have to occupy the territory. Every victory has a cost. And Tlacalel is the first one to realize the costs are starting to outweigh the benefits. The maize fields can only produce so many new people, you know, so many new soldiers. The birth rate is a constant. But the death rate in these wars. It's a variable. And it's trending up. So he sees the empire as a system that's leaking energy. It's bleeding out slowly, even as it's winning? Yes. The essay uses a term from, of all places, physics and computer science. It calls this unconstrained gradient descent. Okay. You have to unpack that for us. That sounds like something from a machine learning textbook, not a history text. It is, but the metaphor applies beautifully here. Imagine you're running down a very steep hill. You're moving incredibly fast. You're making amazing progress. Gravity's doing all the work for you. It feels like success. You're covering so much ground. You're winning. You're absolutely winning. But you start picking up so much speed that eventually you lose control. You can't stop. Your legs can't keep up. You trip. You crash. You tumble. That is unconstrained gradient descent. It's success without limits, which inevitably leads to catastrophic failure. And for the Mexica, that's just keep conquering. Just keep conquering. Keep expanding. Keep erasing your enemies. You eventually run out of energy. You run out of people. The system can't sustain that kind of momentum. And I guess you also run out of enemies to tax, right? I mean, if you burn down every city you conquer, who is going to pay you tribute next year? It's not a sustainable business, Ma. That's another part of it. Absolutely. Tlachiel realizes that total victory, the thing every general in history supposedly wants, the total annihilation of the enemy, is actually a failure state. A failure state. Wow. Because if you wipe out the enemy, you consume your own resources to do it, and then there's nothing left to harvest. You've actually increased the entropy, the disorder of the whole system to a point of no return. You've created a vacuum. So he has to reframe the entire goal of the empire. He has to literally change the definition of winning. And this is where that logistical accountant mind of his really shines through in the documents. It really does. He stops looking at war as a tool for destruction and starts looking at it as a tool for sustenance, for management. So the big shift is from annihilation to continuity. Exactly. The old goal was to erase the enemy from the board. The new goal is to keep the enemy on the board, but weakened so you can fight them again next season and the season after that. It's almost like... Okay, let me try an analogy. It's like moving from a one-time transaction to a subscription model. That is actually a perfect analogy. That's fantastic. Right. Instead of buying the car, conquering the city, looting it, burning it down, and you're done, you lease it. You want the enemy to be there next year and the year after that. You want a reliable, predictable stream of conflict. You want a renewable resource of conflict. The SA argues very strongly that Tlacolol is not a pacifist. This is really, really important to understand. He's not trying to create world peace. No, far from it. He's trying to create sustainable violence. Sustainable violence. I mean, that just sounds like an oxymoron. It's like dry water or cold fire. It does. But in systems theory, it makes perfect sense. He wants to turn a chaotic explosion, which is what war normally is, into what the SA calls a controlled oscillation. Think of a sine wave. Up and down, predictable, manageable, cyclical. Not a single massive spike that flatlines. Exactly. He wants to phase-lock the violence of the entire region so it doesn't spiral out of control and consume everyone, including his own people. Which is an incredible ambition. But it leads us right to part two. How do you actually design a flower war? Because, you know, it's one thing to have this brilliant idea in your study, counting stones, but executing it. That requires changing human behavior on a massive scale. The colossal scale. You have a culture of elite warriors who have been raised since birth to kill, and now you have to go to them and say, okay, guys, don't kill too much. Just enough. And this is where we get into what the documents call the mechanics of constraint. The SA has this phrase that I find incredibly useful. Constraint before content. Okay. What does that mean exactly? Constraint before content. It means, to lack of a little, understands that you cannot easily change human nature. You can't just go to a warrior and say, hey, be nicer. It doesn't work. The content of their character, their training, their whole worldview is aggressive. So you don't try to change what's inside their head? No. He doesn't try to change the content of the warrior's hearts. He changes the constraints around them. He redesigns the container. He changes the rules of the game so that they have to act differently whether they want to or not. Their internal motivations almost become irrelevant. So he sets up the board. He defines the playing field. What are the rules of this new game? There are three main pillars of constraint that the documents lay out. The first one is scheduling. This is huge. War no longer happens because some lord got angry or some ambitious captain saw an opportunity. Right. It's not based on impulse. Not at all. It happens on a calendar. It happens when the math says it should happen. There's a pre-agreed upon time and place. That immediately takes the raw emotional impulse out of it. It's not, I hate you, so I'm attacking you right now. It's Tuesday, the third week of the dry season. So we have a scheduled conflict. It bureaucratizes the anger. That's a great way of putting it. It removes the emotional volatility from the equation. The second pillar is the field. This is absolutely crucial. The screenplay describes the specific marked out boundaries for the battle. Like a literal field. A literal field. Sometimes a valley, sometimes a plain. But it's agreed upon. Inside the lines, it's war. The rules of violence apply. Outside the lines, it's peace. It's what the essay calls a commit boundary. You know exactly where the danger is and where it is not. It reminds me of a sports arena. You know, once you step onto the pitch or the court, the rules of the game apply. You can tackle someone in football, but the second you step off that field, you can't just go tackle a stranger on the street. Precisely. It compartmentalizes the violence. It gives it a beginning and an end, both in time and in space. And the third pillar, this is the biggest cultural shift of all. The objective. It's not kill. It's not kill. It's capture. And this is where the flower part of the flower wars comes in, right? The capture of a worthy opponent is the flower that you bring back. Metaphorically, yes. The captive is the blossom of the battlefield. But from a system's perspective, capture is the mechanism of preservation. If you kill a man, he's gone. His potential is zero. He can't fight again. He can't be ransomed. He can't be sacrificed. The resource is spent. But if you capture him. If you capture him, the event is recorded. Status is gained by the warrior who captured him. But the biological resource, the human being, is preserved, at least temporarily. But here's where it gets really, really interesting for me, the technology aspect of this. Oh, yes. The character Ixlil, the weapon crafter in the compendium. I loved this scene in the screenplay. Klikilil goes to his workshop and they are literally breaking the weapons on purpose. Or not breaking them, but modifying them. It's what the essay calls the paradox of technology in this system. Ixlil is the master craftsman. He's been making these mekohitli, you know, those famous wooden swords embedded with razor shark obsidian blades his whole life. His entire pride is in their lethality. And Tlacalil comes to him and asks him to make them worse. Worse at killing, yes. He asks him to modify them. To dull the obsidian edges near the handle so a warrior can parry without losing a hand. To modify the tips so they're less likely to deliver a fatal puncture wound. He's intentionally engineering inefficiency into the weapon. It's just so counterintuitive. I mean, think about our entire military history. It's always about being more lethal. We build faster missiles, bigger bombs, sharper swords. Here they are deliberately putting a governor on the engine. They're making their primary instrument of war less deadly. But, and this is the key insight from the compendium from Ixlil's character, this requires more skill from the warrior, not less. Ixlil has this great line. He says, obsidian doesn't forgive intention. It's so sharp it just cuts. It's much, much harder to disable a man and take him prisoner than it is to just swing wildly and kill him. To capture someone alive, you have to completely dominate them. You have to outskill them, but you have to restrain yourself at the final crucial moment. So the warriors have to be better. They have to have more control, more discipline. It turns war from a brawl into a high-stakes sport. Precisely. It turns it into a martial art rather than just a slaughter. The skill ceiling is actually raised. The SA uses that physics metaphor again, talking about phase locking. Tlai Kallil isn't trying to stop the energy of violence. He's trying to phase lock it. He wants everyone on both sides vibrating at the same frequency. So everyone agrees on the time, the place, the weapons, and the objective. And if everyone agrees, the violence becomes. The SA uses the word laminar, like water flowing smoothly in layers instead of turbulent, which is chaotic and unpredictable. Laminar violence. I'm going to be thinking about that for a while. Me too. But, and there's always a but in systems engineering, isn't there? When you build a system that relies so heavily on everyone playing nice, on everyone agreeing to the rules, you create new vulnerability. Create a system that is very efficient within its own context, but maybe, maybe very fragile if something from outside that context shows up. Exactly. And that fragility brings us to part three, the human infrastructure. Because you can write all the rules you want, but you still need people to run the system. And not everyone is on board with Kalei Kallil's grand vision. No. And this is where Mark Azuma comes in. In the source material, he's not the emperor yet, not the one we know from the history books. He's a powerful war captain. And he is positioned as the rival systems engineer. He's the great skeptic. And his argument is pretty compelling, honestly. It's not a straw man argument. He says, very plainly, deterrence requires fear. It's the classic real politic argument, right? It's the stick. Need the big stick. It is. Mark Azuma looks at these highly ritualized flower wars, and he worries. He says, if war becomes predictable, if it becomes safe, then the enemies of the empire won't fear them anymore. They'll start to see this restraint, not as discipline, but as weakness. There's that amazing scene set in the emperor's garden. It's Kunal, the current emperor, is pruning flowers. And he uses this very elegant metaphor, comparing the empire to a garden. He says it needs careful pruning to grow strong. A beautiful image. But Mike Azuma is not impressed by poetry. He counters by warning that predictability erodes deterrence. If the enemy city-state knows for a fact that you aren't going to burn their city to the ground, if they know you're just going to show up, capture a few of their guys, and then go home until next season, why should they continue to pay tribute? Why should they submit? What's their incentive to obey, other than, you know, a bit of inconvenience once a year? It's a very valid critique. Kalakalel thinks he's building sustainability and control. Moctezuma looks at the same system and thinks he's building a trap for themselves. He believes that without the genuine, credible threat of total destruction held in reserve, the tributary states will eventually get brave and revolt. And then you've got Tizok, the high priest. He adds this whole other layer of skepticism from a completely different angle. He's not worried about military deterrence. He's worried about faith. Yes. He has that line that, I mean, it gave me chills. He warns that ritual without danger becomes theater. Ritual without danger becomes theater. Oof. He's saying that if the war gets too clean, if it gets too choreographed and safe, the gods won't respect it. And more importantly, the people won't respect it. It just becomes a performance, a pageant. And performances don't hold empires together. No. He believes the universe demands entropy. It demands real blood, real risk, real chaos. If you try to sanitize it too much, if you try to make it too neat, the system loses its metaphysical weight. It becomes hollow. So you have these high-level debates happening in the halls of power. The engineer, the general, the priest. But while they're all arguing philosophy, the system itself is actually running on the backs of people like Jochitl. Jochitl, the runner. I feel like she's the unsung hero of this whole story, honestly. She's the embodiment of the system's infrastructure. She's the one actually making it work on the ground, day in and day out. The essay describes her and the other runners as the vector field. She is the infrastructure. She's not a general or a priest with grand theories. She is the one carrying the messages. She's the fiber-optic cable of the Triple Alliance. And she carries the death whistle. Which, I have to say, that detail in the screenplay was fascinating. It's an incredible reinterpretation. We usually think of the Aztec death whistle as this ultimate instrument of psychological terror, right? It's a ceramic skull that makes it sound like a human screaming in agony. Right. It's the sound of nightmares. You hear that sound on the battlefield and your blood runs cold. You freeze. But in Talaquil's engineered system, it's repurposed. It's given a new job. It becomes a boundary marker. It's the referee's whistle. A specific series of blasts signals the start of the engagement and another signals the end. That is such a huge shift in meaning. It takes the most terrifying sound imaginable and turns it into a tool of order. It goes from, I am coming to kill you, to game on and game off. It really shows how communication is more durable than stone. The essay makes this point that even when the councils are deadlocked in debate, even when the policy is failing at the highest levels, the runners keep running. The vectors persist. Chichita's the glue holding this whole fragile agreement together. She is the one making sure that Tlaxcowians know the schedule for next month's war. If she fails, if the message doesn't get through, the whole phase lock falls apart. And then you have the warriors themselves, the grunts on the ground. There's that character in the compendium, Yaconex, a young recruit. He has to learn a whole new grammar of war. Aspect relegation. That's the term the essay uses for what he's going through. It's a psychological concept. Yaconex has to train his own mind, his own reflexes, to say, I capture instead of, I kill. Which sounds simple when you say it, but in the heat of battle. When your adrenaline is pumping and someone is swinging an obsidian-bladed club at your head, that's rewiring your most basic survival instincts. It is. The instinct is to end the threat permanently. Yeah. He has to suppress that urge and replace it with a much more complex, much more difficult action. So he's got to relegate that killing aspect to the background. Exactly. And the essay argues that this relegation, when practiced by a whole generation of warriors, creates a profound psychological shift. The violence gets compressed into habit. It gets ritualized. The warriors stop seeing it as extraordinary mercy or a strange new rule. They just see it as the job. This is how war is done. It becomes normal. But that compression, that normalization, it creates a blind spot, doesn't it? A huge blind spot. If you get too used to the compressed version of violence, the ritual, the rules, the whistles, the relative safety, you might forget what actual, unconstrained, high-resolution violence looks like. You might forget that not everyone in the world plays by your rules. You might forget that outside the carefully tended garden of your system, the jungle is still wild. And that that is the perfect setup for the disaster. Part four. The out-of-context problem. The system crash. The arrival of the Spanish. Now, this is one of the most famous stories in history, but the way these documents frame it, it's completely different from anything I've ever read before. It's fascinating. Usually this story is told as the conquest. It's a story of guns, germs, and steel. It's Cortez, the brilliant conquistador, versus Moctezuma, the doomed emperor. It's a clash of civilizations, usually framed as advanced versus primitive. Right, a morality play. But the source material explicitly avoids that. It doesn't frame this as good versus evil or even really strength versus weakness. It frames it as a protocol mismatch. A protocol mismatch. I love that term. It's like trying to plug a USB drive into a toaster. Yeah. It doesn't compute. The two systems are fundamentally incompatible. The Spanish are described in the essay as an outside context problem. They are a variable that Tlacalel's system was never designed to handle. They simply do not recognize the field. There's that powerful scene on the coast. So Chiddle, the runner, is the first to see them. She runs to the beach. She sees the ships like floating mountains. She sees the men in metal. She sees the horses, which are like giant deer. And she's waiting for something. A signal. A banner. A drum. A declaration of intent. She's waiting for the handshake. She's waiting for the protocol to begin. She's looking for someone to tell her the time and place for the flower war. And it never comes. The essay says the Spanish short-circuit the system. They operate completely outside the commit boundaries. They don't wait for the whistle. They don't care about the calendar. And they definitely do not care about capturing people alive. The Chiddle has that heartbreaking line. She observes them and reports back, they do not wait. They do not mirror. And in that one sentence, she understands that the entire language of war she has known her whole life is useless here. And this is what the sources call the tragedy of compatibility. Tlaxcalo's system, for all its brilliance, relied entirely on mutual recognition. It worked with their traditional enemies, the Tlaxcans, because the Tlaxcans agreed to play. They hated the Mexicans, sure, but they agreed on the format of the hatred. They agreed on the rules of the game. It's like, imagine two master chess players. They might despise each other personally, but they both agree on how the knight moves, how the bishop moves, the Spanish show up, and they don't play chess. They flip the board over, shoot the other player, and set the table on fire. A perfect analogy. And because the Mexicans system is so specialized and so finely tuned to this one specific game, it doesn't just fail gracefully. It doesn't bend. It shatters. It collapses instantly. The essay calls it a failure of relegation. All that violent impulse the Mexico warriors had trained themselves to suppress. They can't just switch it back on overnight. No, and the Spanish violence is. It's high resolution. It's uncompressed. It's raw, chaotic, efficient killing. It has no ritual attached, and it completely shocks the Mexica system. And the Mexico warriors, who have spent a generation training to not kill, to aim for the limbs, to listen for the signal, to work as a team, to capture, not annihilate, they are completely cognitively unprepared for this. It's a cognitive shock more than anything else. They're looking for the rules, and there are none. Talakalo's beautiful architecture, his carefully constructed, phase-locked sine wave of violence. It meets a tsunami. And a sine wave, no matter how elegant, cannot stop a tsunami. It's a complete systems failure. So the system crashes hard. The flower wars end, not with a treaty, but with a horrifying reality check. The screenplay has these scenes of just utter chaos. Moctezuma, now emperor, tries to go back to the old ways, to unleash unrestricted force, but it's too late. The rhythm is broken. The muscle memory is gone. And Tezok, the priest, he reacts the way feeling systems so often do. He panics and tries to escalate the old solution. He dramatically increases the sacrifices. His logic is, if the system isn't working, it must be because we're not doing it harder. Which is so tragic. It's mistaking volume for control. It's just, it's the desperate act of a man who sees the universe he understood falling apart and thinks he can fix it by shouting louder at the gods. It's panic. But, and this is where this deep dug gets really profound for me, the story in these documents doesn't just end with the crash. It doesn't end with the fall of the city. No. Part five, irreversibility in memory. This is where the source material just, it elevates the entire narrative. It asks the question, what happens after the end of your world? What survives the crash? And the essay introduces another concept from computer science, event-sourced civilization. What does that even mean? It's a way of thinking about data. In an event-sourced system, the truth isn't just the current state of things, like the balance in your bank account. The truth is the complete, unchangeable log of every transaction that ever happened. The whole ledger. The ledger, right. And Tlachalel, from the very beginning, was always counting. Remember scene one, counting the stones? He was a record keeper. The flower wars, in a way, were a method to log violence, to keep a meticulous record, to say, this happened at this time with these people, and this was the result. It was a living ledger of the empire's power. Yes. And when the Spanish arrive and the whole system crashes, Tlachalel, now an old man, has this final, brilliant insight. He realizes he can't save the government. He can't save the empire. He can't save the current state. It's over. But he can save the log. He can save the memory. He can preserve the ledger. He pivots. He changes his role one last time. He stops being the architect of the system and becomes the teacher of its memory. There's that incredible scene in the screenplay, late in the story. The city is in ruins. There's chaos everywhere. And Tlachalel is sitting in the rubble with a group of children. He's not telling them how to fight. He's not telling them how to win. He's telling them what they tried to do. He's telling them about the rules. This is what the essay calls graceful degradation. The system fails as a functioning state, but it doesn't just vanish into nothingness. It leaves a residue. It leaves a lesson. It degrades gracefully into knowledge. The ending of the screenplay is just, it's so haunting. It's years later, an empty field, no warfers, no banners, no blood, just grass growing over the old boundary stones. And someone we don't know who blows a single long note on a death whistle. But not as a command. No, as a memory, as an echo. And the essay argues that the system didn't last forever, but that doesn't mean it was a waste. It proved something. It proved that human beings can choose to limit their own violence, even if it was only for a short time, even if it was imperfect, and ultimately failed against an outside force. It happened. It's in the log. The event was recorded. Architecture outlives ideology. That's the quote from the essay that has been stuck in my head all week. It's such a powerful idea, isn't it? The specific beliefs, the gods they worship, the politics of the Triple Alliance, those fade. They become footnotes. But the structure, the idea that we can build boundaries around our own worst impulses, that remains. The geometry of the idea survives, even if the building itself is crumbled. So let's zoom out for the outro. What does this all mean for us? Because we aren't Mexico. We don't fight with obsidian swords. But we are damn sure fighting entropy every single day. We absolutely are. I think the final synthesis of these sources is a really bold claim. We shouldn't judge civilizations by whether they lasted forever. Because nothing lasts forever. The Roman Empire fell. The Han Dynasty fell. The Mexico fell. And, you know, spoiler alert, our civilization will fall too, eventually. Well, that's a cheerful thought. Thanks for that. Hey, but it's accurate. The metric shouldn't be permanence. The essay suggests the metric should be how they handled their internal entropy while they were here. What problems did they try to solve? And the Flower Wars were a, what does it call it? A time-limited counterexample. A time-limited counterexample to the idea that war must always be total destruction. Yeah. It challenges the lazy assumption that the only path for conflict is escalation. It says, hey, for a few generations, we tried something else. It didn't work forever, but we tried. It is possible. Exactly. And when you look at our modern world, I mean, look around. We have information overload, which is a form of entropy. We have political conflict that feels like it's spiraling. We build these global systems, financial, communications, supply chains, that are incredibly efficient, but maybe, just maybe, incredibly brittle. We have optimized for efficiency, just like Tockello's system was optimized for a very specific kind of ritualized war. And that makes me wonder if we are just as vulnerable to our own outside context problem, something we just can't see coming because it doesn't fit our model of the world. And the provocative thought to leave you, the listener, with is this. Are we building systems today that can degrade gracefully? When our protocols fail, and they will fail, when our technology hits a wall, when our political agreements break down, what remains? Is there a log? Is there a memory? Do we have a Yaquitel running the last messages? Do we have a Tockello sitting in the ruins teaching the children the lesson of what we tried to build? Or are we building systems that will just collapse efficiently, systems that are so tightly coupled and optimized for growth that once they break, they leave nothing behind but dust? That really is the question, isn't it? It is. Architecture outlives ideology. It makes you look at your own life, your own society, and wonder, what are the boundary stones we're placing today? And will they hold when the whistle blows? A powerful question to end on. Thank you for taking this deep dive with us. It was a heavy one, but I think a really necessary one. My pleasure, it was a lot to think about. Until next time, keep counting the stones. And watch the horizon.
